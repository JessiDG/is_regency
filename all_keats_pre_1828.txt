PREFACE

The object of the present volume is to supply the want, which many readers must have felt, of a separate and convenient edition of the letters of Keats to his family and friends. He is one of those poets whose genius makes itself felt in prose-writing almost as decisively as in verse, and at their best these letters are among the most beautiful in our language. Portions of them lent an especial charm to a book charming at any rate—the biography of the poet first published more than forty years ago by Lord Houghton. But the correspondence as given by Lord Houghton is neither accurate nor complete. He had in few cases the originals before him, but made use of copies, some of them quite fragmentary, especially those supplied him from America; and moreover, working while many of the poet’s friends were still alive, he thought it right to exercise a degree of editorial freedom for which there would now be neither occasion nor excuse. While I was engaged in preparing the life of Keats for Mr. Morley’s series some years since, the following materials for an improved edition of his letters came into my hands:—

(1) The copies made by Richard Woodhouse, a few years after Keats’s death, of the poet’s correspondence with his principal friends, viz. the publishers, Messrs. Taylor and Hessey; the transcriber, Woodhouse himself, who was a young barrister of literary tastes in the confidence of those gentlemen; John Hamilton Reynolds, solicitor, poet, humourist, and critic (born 1796, died[Pg xii] 1852); Jane and Mariane Reynolds, sisters of the last-named, the former afterwards Mrs. Tom Hood; James Rice, the bosom friend of Reynolds, and like him a young solicitor; Benjamin Bailey, undergraduate of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, afterwards Archdeacon of Colombo (1794?-1852), and one or two more.

(2) The imperfect copies of the poet’s letters to his brother and sister-in-law in America, which were made by the sister-in-law’s second husband, Mr. Jeffrey of Louisville, and sent by him to Lord Houghton, who published them with further omissions and alterations of his own.

(3) Somewhat later, after the publication of my book, the autograph originals of some of these same letters to America were put into my hands, including almost the entire text of Nos. lxiii. lxxiii. lxxx. and xcii. in the present edition. The three last are the long and famous journal-letters written in the autumn of 1818 and spring of 1819, and between them occupy nearly a quarter of the whole volume. I have shown elsewhere[1] how much of their value and interest was sacrificed by Mr. Jeffrey’s omissions.

Besides these manuscript sources, I have drawn largely on Mr. Buxton Forman’s elaborate edition of Keats’s works in four volumes (1883),[2] and to a much less extent on the[Pg xiii] edition published by the poet’s American grand nephew, Mr. Speed (1884)[3]. Even thus, the correspondence is still probably not quite complete. In some of the voluminous journal-letters there may still be gaps, where a sheet of the autograph has gone astray; and since the following pages have been in print, I have heard of the existence in private collections of one or two letters which I have not been able to include. But it is not a case in which absolute completeness is of much importance.

In matters of the date and sequence of the letters, I have taken pains to be more exact than previous editors, especially in tracing the daily progress and different halting-places of the poet on his Scotch tour (which it takes some knowledge of the ground to do), and in dating the successive parts, written at intervals sometimes during two or three months, of the long journal-letters to America. On these particulars Keats himself is very vague, and his manuscript sometimes runs on without a break at points where the sense shows that he has dropped and taken it up again after a pause of days or weeks.[4] Again, I have in all cases given in full the verse and other quotations contained in the correspondence, where other editors have only indicated them by their first lines. It is indeed from these that the letters derive a great part of their character. Writing to his nearest relatives or most intimate friends, he is always quoting for their pleasure poems of his own now classical, then warm from his brain, sent forth uncertain whether to live or die, or snatches of doggrel nonsense as the humour of the moment takes him. The former, familiar as we may be with them, gain a new interest and freshness from the context: the latter are nothing apart from it, and to[Pg xiv] print them gravely, as has been done, among the Poetical Works, is to punish the levities of genius too hard.

As to the text, I have followed the autograph wherever it was possible, and in other cases the manuscript or printed version which I judged nearest the autograph; with this exception, that I have not thought it worth while to preserve mere slips of the pen or tricks of spelling. The curious in such matters will find them religiously reproduced by Mr. Buxton Forman wherever he has had the opportunity. The poet’s punctuation, on the other hand, and his use of capitals, which is odd and full of character, I have preserved. As is well known, his handwriting is as a rule clear and beautiful, quite free from unsteadiness or sign of fatigue; and as mere specimens for the collector, few autographs can compare with these close-written quarto (or sometimes extra folio) sheets, in which the young poet has poured out to those he loved his whole self indiscriminately, generosity and fretfulness, ardour and despondency, boyish petulance side by side with manful good sense, the tattle of suburban parlours with the speculations of a spirit unsurpassed for native poetic gift and insight.

The editor of familiar correspondence has at all times a difficult task before him in the choice what to give and what to withhold. In the case of Keats the difficulty is greater than in most, from the ferment of opposing elements and impulses in his nature, and from the extreme unreserve with which he lays himself open alike in his weakness and his strength. The other great letter-writers in English are men to some degree on their guard: men, if not of the world, at least of some worldly training and experience, and of characters in some degree formed and set. The phase of unlimited youthful expansiveness, of enthusiastic or fretful outcry, they have either escaped or left behind, and never give themselves away completely. Gray is of course an extreme case in point. With a masterly breadth of mind he unites an even finicking degree of academic fastidiousness[Pg xv] and personal reserve, and his correspondence charms, not by impulse or openness, but by urbanity and irony, by ripeness of judgment and knowledge, by his playful kindliness towards the few intimates he has, and the sober wistfulness with which he looks out, from his Pisgah-height of universal culture, over regions of imaginative delight into which it was not given to him nor his contemporaries to enter fully. To take others differing most widely both as men and poets: Cowper, whether affectionately “chatting and chirping” to his cousin Lady Hesketh, or confiding his spiritual terrors to the Rev. John Newton, that unwise monitor who would not let them sleep,—Cowper is a letter-writer the most unaffected and sincere, but has nevertheless the degree of reticence natural to his breeding, as well as a touch of staidness and formality proper to his age. Byron offers an extreme contrast; unrestrained he is, but far indeed from being unaffected; the greatest attitudinist in literature as in life, and the most brilliant of all letter-writers after his fashion, with his wit, his wilfulness, his flash, his extraordinary unscrupulousness and resource, his vulgar pride of caste, his everlasting restlessness and egotism, his occasional true irradiations of the divine fire. Shelley, again—but he, as has been justly said, must have his singing robes about him to be quite truly Shelley, and in his correspondence is little more than any other amiable and enthusiastic gentleman and scholar on his travels. To the case of Keats, at any rate, none of these other distinguished letter-writers affords any close parallel. That admirable genius was from the social point of view an unformed lad in the flush and rawness of youth. His passion for beauty, his instinctive insight into the vital sources of imaginative delight in nature, in romance, and in antiquity, went along with perceptions painfully acute in matters of daily life, and nerves high-strung in the extreme. He was moreover almost incapable of artifice or disguise. Writing to his brothers and sister or to friends as dear,[Pg xvi] he is secret with them on one thing only, and that is his unlucky love-passion after he became a prey to it: for the rest he is open as the day, and keeps back nothing of what crosses his mind, nothing that vexes or jars on him or tries his patience. His character, as thus laid bare, contains elements of rare nobility and attraction—modesty, humour, sweetness, courage, impulsive disinterestedness, strong and tender family affection, the gift of righteous indignation, the gift of sober and strict self-knowledge. But it is only a character in the making. A strain of hereditary disease, lurking in his constitution from the first, was developed by over-exertion and aggravated by mischance, so that he never lived to be himself; and from about his twenty-fourth birthday his utterances are those of one struggling in vain against a hopeless distemper both of body and mind.

If a selection could be made from those parts only of Keats’s correspondence which show him at his best, we should have an anthology full of intuitions of beauty, even of wisdom, and breathing the very spirit of generous youth; one unrivalled for zest, whim, fancy, and amiability, and written in an English which by its peculiar alert and varied movement sometimes recalls, perhaps more closely than that of any other writer (for the young Cockney has Shakspeare in his blood), the prose passages of Hamlet and Much Ado about Nothing. Had the correspondence never been printed before, were it there to be dealt with for the first time, this method of selection would no doubt be the tempting one to apply to it. But such a treatment is now hardly possible, and in any case would hardly be quite fair; since the object, or at all events the effect, of publishing a man’s correspondence is not merely to give literary pleasure—it is to make the man himself known; and the revelation, though it need not be wholly without reserve, is bound to be just and proportionate as far as it goes. Even as an artist, in the work which he himself published to the world, Keats was not one of those of whom it[Pg xvii] could be said, “his worst he kept, his best he gave.” Rather he gave promiscuously, in the just confidence that among the failures and half-successes of his inexperienced youth would be found enough of the best to establish his place among the poets after his death. Considering all things, the nature of the man, the difficulty of separating the exquisite from the common, the healthful from the diseased, in his mind and work, considering also the use that has already been made of the materials, I have decided in this edition to give the correspondence almost unpruned; omitting a few passages of mere crudity, hardly more than two pages in all, but not attempting to suppress those which betray the weak places in the writer’s nature, his flaws of taste and training, his movements of waywardness, irritability, and morbid suspicion. Only the biographer without tact, the critic without balance, will insist on these. A truer as well as more charitable judgment will recognise that what was best in Keats was also what was most real, and will be fortified by remembering that to those who knew him his faults were almost unapparent, and that no man was ever held by his friends in more devoted or more unanimous affection while he lived and afterwards.

There is one thing, however, which I have not chosen to do, and that is to include in this collection the poet’s love-letters to Fanny Brawne. As it is, the intimate nature of the correspondence must sometimes give the reader a sense of eavesdropping, of being admitted into petty private matters with which he has no concern. If this is to some extent inevitable, it is by no means inevitable that the public should be farther asked to look over the shoulder of the sick and presently dying youth while he declares the impatience and torment of his passion to the object, careless and unresponsive as she seems to have been, who inspired it. These letters too have been printed. As a matter of feeling I cannot put myself in the place of the reader who desires to possess[Pg xviii] them; while as a matter of literature they are in a different key from the rest,—not lacking passages of beauty, but constrained and painful in the main, and quite without the genial ease and play of mind which make the letters to his family and friends so attractive. Therefore in this, which I hope may become the standard edition of his correspondence, they shall find no place.

As to the persons, other than those already mentioned, to whom the letters here given are addressed:—Shelley of course needs no words; nor should any be needed for the painter Haydon (1786-1846), or the poet and critic Leigh Hunt (1784-1859). Theirs were the chief inspiring influences which determined the young medical student, about his twentieth year, at the time when this correspondence opens, to give up his intended profession for poetry. Both were men of remarkable gifts and strong intellectual enthusiasm, hampered in either case by foibles of character which their young friend and follower, who has left so far more illustrious a name, was only too quick to detect. Charles Cowden Clarke (1787-1877), the son of Keats’s schoolmaster at Enfield, had exercised a still earlier influence on the lad’s opening mind, and was himself afterwards long and justly distinguished as a Shakspearean student and lecturer and essayist on English literature. Charles Wentworth Dilke (1789-1864), having begun life in the Civil Service, early abandoned that calling for letters, and lived to be one of the most influential of English critics and journalists; he is chiefly known from his connection with the Athenæum, and through the memoir published by his grandson. Charles Brown, afterwards styling himself Charles Armitage Brown (1786-1842), who became known to Keats through Dilke in the summer of 1817, and was his most intimate companion during the two years June 1818 to June 1820, had begun life as a merchant in St. Petersburg, and failing, came home, and took, he also, to literature, chiefly as a contributor to the various periodicals edited by Leigh Hunt. He lived[Pg xix] mostly in Italy from 1822 to 1834, then for six years at Plymouth, and in 1841 emigrated to New Zealand, where he died the following year. Joseph Severn (1793-1879) was the son of a musician, himself beginning to practise as a painter when Keats knew him. His devoted tendance of the poet during the last sad months in Italy was the determining event of Severn’s career, earning him the permanent regard and gratitude of all lovers of genius. He established himself for good in Rome, where he continued to practise his art, and was for many years English consul, and one of the most familiar figures in the society of the city.

Lastly, of the poet’s own relations, George Keats (1799-1842) after his brother’s death continued to live at Louisville in America, where he made and lost a fortune in business before he died. His widow (born Georgiana Augusta Wylie), so often and affectionately addressed in these letters, by and by took a second husband, a Mr. Jeffrey, already mentioned as the correspondent of Lord Houghton. Frances Mary Keats (1803-1889), always called Fanny in the delightful series of letters which her brother addressed to her as a young girl,[5] in course of time married a Spanish gentleman, Señor Llanos, and lived in Madrid to a great old age. Several other members of the poet’s circle enjoyed unusual length of days—Mr. William Dilke, for instance, dying a few years ago at ninety, and Mr. Gleig, long Chaplain-General of the Forces, at ninety-two. But with the death of his sister a year and a half ago, passed away probably the last survivor of those who could bear in memory the voice and features of Adonais.

LETTERS OF JOHN KEATS
TO
HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS





I.—TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.
[London, October 31, 1816.]

My daintie Davie—I will be as punctual as the Bee to the Clover. Very glad am I at the thoughts of seeing so soon this glorious Haydon and all his creation. I pray thee let me know when you go to Ollier’s and where he resides—this I forgot to ask you—and tell me also when you will help me waste a sullen day—God ’ield you[6]—

J. K.





II.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
[London,] November 20, 1816.

My dear Sir—Last evening wrought me up, and I cannot forbear sending you the following—

Yours unfeignedly,
John Keats.

Removed to 76 Cheapside.

[Pg 2] Great spirits now on earth are sojourning;
He of the cloud, the cataract, the lake,
Who on Helvellyn’s summit, wide awake,
Catches his freshness from Archangel’s wing:
He of the rose, the violet, the spring,
The social smile, the chain for Freedom’s sake:
And lo!—whose stedfastness would never take
A meaner sound than Raphael’s whispering.
And other spirits there are standing apart
Upon the forehead of the age to come;
These, these will give the world another heart,
And other pulses. Hear ye not the hum
Of mighty workings in the human mart?
Listen awhile ye nations, and be dumb.[7]





III.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
[London,] Thursday afternoon, November 20, 1816.

My dear Sir—Your letter has filled me with a proud pleasure, and shall be kept by me as a stimulus to exertion—I begin to fix my eye upon one horizon. My feelings entirely fall in with yours in regard to the Ellipsis, and I glory in it. The Idea of your sending it to Wordsworth put me out of breath—you know with what Reverence I would send my Well-wishes to him.

Yours sincerely
John Keats.





IV.—TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.
[London,] Tuesday [December 17, 1816].

My dear Charles—You may now look at Minerva’s Ægis with impunity, seeing that my awful Visage[8] did not turn you into a John Doree. You have accordingly a legitimate title to a Copy—I will use my interest to procure it for you. I’ll tell you what—I met Reynolds at Haydon’s a few mornings since—he promised to be with me this Evening and Yesterday I had the same[Pg 3] promise from Severn and I must put you in mind that on last All hallowmas’ day you gave me your word that you would spend this Evening with me—so no putting off. I have done little to Endymion lately[9]—I hope to finish it in one more attack. I believe you I went to Richards’s—it was so whoreson a Night that I stopped there all the next day. His Remembrances to you. (Ext. from the common place Book of my Mind—Mem.—Wednesday—Hampstead—call in Warner Street—a sketch of Mr. Hunt.)—I will ever consider you my sincere and affectionate friend—you will not doubt that I am yours.

God bless you—
John Keats.





V.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
[London,] Sunday Evening [March 2, 1817?].[10]

My dear Reynolds—Your kindness affects me so sensibly that I can merely put down a few mono-sentences. Your Criticism only makes me extremely anxious that I should not deceive you.

It’s the finest thing by God as Hazlitt would say. However I hope I may not deceive you. There are some acquaintances of mine who will scratch their Beards and although I have, I hope, some Charity, I wish their Nails may be long. I will be ready at the time you mention in all Happiness.

There is a report that a young Lady of 16 has written the new Tragedy, God bless her—I will know her by Hook or by Crook in less than a week. My Brothers’ and my Remembrances to your kind Sisters.

Yours most sincerely
John Keats.





[Pg 4]

VI.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
[London, March 17, 1817.]

My dear Reynolds—My Brothers are anxious that I should go by myself into the country—they have always been extremely fond of me, and now that Haydon has pointed out how necessary it is that I should be alone to improve myself, they give up the temporary pleasure of living with me continually for a great good which I hope will follow. So I shall soon be out of Town. You must soon bring all your present troubles to a close, and so must I, but we must, like the Fox, prepare for a fresh swarm of flies. Banish money—Banish sofas—Banish Wine—Banish Music; but right Jack Health, honest Jack Health, true Jack Health—Banish health and banish all the world. I must ... if I come this evening, I shall horribly commit myself elsewhere. So I will send my excuses to them and Mrs. Dilke by my brothers.

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





VII.—TO GEORGE AND THOMAS KEATS.
[Southampton,] Tuesday Morn [April 15, 1817].

My dear Brothers—I am safe at Southampton—after having ridden three stages outside and the rest in for it began to be very cold. I did not know the Names of any of the Towns I passed through—all I can tell you is that sometimes I saw dusty Hedges—sometimes Ponds—then nothing—then a little Wood with trees look you like Launce’s Sister “as white as a Lily and as small as a Wand”—then came houses which died away into a few straggling Barns—then came hedge trees aforesaid again. As the Lamplight crept along the following things were discovered—“long heath broom furze”—Hurdles here and there half a Mile—Park palings when the Windows of a House were always discovered by[Pg 5] reflection—One Nymph of Fountain—N.B. Stone—lopped Trees—Cow ruminating—ditto Donkey—Man and Woman going gingerly along—William seeing his Sisters over the Heath—John waiting with a Lanthorn for his Mistress—Barber’s Pole—Doctor’s Shop—However after having had my fill of these I popped my Head out just as it began to Dawn—N.B. this Tuesday Morn saw the Sun rise—of which I shall say nothing at present. I felt rather lonely this Morning at Breakfast so I went and unbox’d a Shakspeare—“There’s my Comfort.”[11] I went immediately after Breakfast to Southampton Water where I enquired for the Boat to the Isle of Wight as I intend seeing that place before I settle—it will go at 3, so shall I after having taken a Chop. I know nothing of this place but that it is long—tolerably broad—has bye streets—two or three Churches—a very respectable old Gate with two Lions to guard it. The Men and Women do not materially differ from those I have been in the Habit of seeing. I forgot to say that from dawn till half-past six I went through a most delightful Country—some open Down but for the most part thickly wooded. What surprised me most was an immense quantity of blooming Furze on each side the road cutting a most rural dash. The Southampton water when I saw it just now was no better than a low Water Water which did no more than answer my expectations—it will have mended its Manners by 3. From the Wharf are seen the shores on each side stretching to the Isle of Wight. You, Haydon, Reynolds, etc. have been pushing each other out of my Brain by turns. I have conned over every Head in Haydon’s Picture—you must warn them not to be afraid should my Ghost visit them on Wednesday—tell Haydon to Kiss his Hand at Betty over the Way for me yea and to spy at her for me. I hope one of you will be competent to take part in a Trio while I am away—you need only[Pg 6] aggravate your voices a little and mind not to speak Cues and all—when you have said Rum-ti-ti—you must not be rum any more or else another will take up the ti-ti alone and then he might be taken God shield us for little better than a Titmouse. By the by talking of Titmouse Remember me particularly to all my Friends—give my Love to the Miss Reynoldses and to Fanny who I hope you will soon see. Write to me soon about them all—and you George particularly how you get on with Wilkinson’s plan. What could I have done without my Plaid? I don’t feel inclined to write any more at present for I feel rather muzzy—you must be content with this fac simile of the rough plan of Aunt Dinah’s Counterpane.

Your most affectionate Brother
John Keats.

Reynolds shall hear from me soon.





VIII.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
Carisbrooke, April 17th [1817].

My dear Reynolds—Ever since I wrote to my Brothers from Southampton I have been in a taking—and at this moment I am about to become settled—for I have unpacked my books, put them into a snug corner, pinned up Haydon, Mary Queen of Scots, and Milton with his daughters in a row. In the passage I found a head of Shakspeare which I had not before seen. It is most likely the same that George spoke so well of, for I like it extremely. Well—this head I have hung over my Books, just above the three in a row, having first discarded a French Ambassador—now this alone is a good morning’s work. Yesterday I went to Shanklin, which occasioned a great debate in my mind whether I should live there or at Carisbrooke. Shanklin is a most beautiful place—Sloping wood and meadow ground reach round the Chine, which is a cleft between the Cliffs of the depth of nearly 300 feet at least. This cleft is filled with trees and[Pg 7] bushes in the narrow part, and as it widens becomes bare, if it were not for primroses on one side, which spread to the very verge of the Sea, and some fishermen’s huts on the other, perched midway in the Balustrades of beautiful green Hedges along their steps down to the sands. But the sea, Jack, the sea—the little waterfall—then the white cliff—then St. Catherine’s Hill—“the sheep in the meadows, the cows in the corn.” Then, why are you at Carisbrooke? say you. Because, in the first place, I should be at twice the Expense, and three times the inconvenience—next that from here I can see your continent—from a little hill close by the whole north Angle of the Isle of Wight, with the water between us. In the 3rd place, I see Carisbrooke Castle from my window, and have found several delightful wood-alleys, and copses, and quick freshes.[12] As for primroses—the Island ought to be called Primrose Island—that is, if the nation of Cowslips agree thereto, of which there are divers Clans just beginning to lift up their heads. Another reason of my fixing is, that I am more in reach of the places around me. I intend to walk over the Island east—West—North—South. I have not seen many specimens of Ruins—I don’t think however I shall ever see one to surpass Carisbrooke Castle. The trench is overgrown with the smoothest turf, and the Walls with ivy. The Keep within side is one Bower of ivy—a colony of Jackdaws have been there for many years. I dare say I have seen many a descendant of some old cawer who peeped through the Bars at Charles the first, when he was there in Confinement. On the road from Cowes to Newport I saw some extensive Barracks, which disgusted me extremely with the Government for placing such a Nest of Debauchery in so beautiful a place. I asked a man on the Coach about this—and he said that the people had been spoiled. In the room where I slept[Pg 8] at Newport, I found this on the Window—“O Isle spoilt by the milatary!...”

The wind is in a sulky fit, and I feel that it would be no bad thing to be the favourite of some Fairy, who would give one the power of seeing how our Friends got on at a Distance. I should like, of all Loves, a sketch of you and Tom and George in ink which Haydon will do if you tell him how I want them. From want of regular rest I have been rather narvus—and the passage in Lear—“Do you not hear the sea?”—has haunted me intensely.

ON THE SEA

It keeps eternal whisperings around
Desolate shores, and with its mighty swell
Gluts twice ten thousand Caverns, till the spell
Of Hecate leaves them their old shadowy sound.
Often ’tis in such gentle temper found,
That scarcely will the very smallest shell
Be mov’d for days from where it sometime fell,
When last the winds of Heaven were unbound.
O ye! who have your eye-balls vex’d and tir’d,
Feast them upon the wideness of the Sea;
O ye! whose Ears are dinn’d with uproar rude,
Or fed too much with cloying melody—
Sit ye near some old Cavern’s Mouth, and brood
Until ye start as if the sea Nymphs quired—[13]


April 18th.

Will you have the goodness to do this? Borrow a Botanical Dictionary—turn to the words Laurel and Prunus, show the explanations to your sisters and Mrs. Dilke and without more ado let them send me the Cups Basket and Books they trifled and put off and off while I was in town. Ask them what they can say for themselves—ask Mrs. Dilke wherefore she does so distress me—let me know how Jane has her health—the Weather is unfavourable for her. Tell George and Tom to write. I’ll tell you what—on the 23d was Shakspeare born.[Pg 9] Now if I should receive a letter from you and another from my Brothers on that day ’twould be a parlous good thing. Whenever you write say a word or two on some Passage in Shakspeare that may have come rather new to you, which must be continually happening, notwithstanding that we read the same Play forty times—for instance, the following from the Tempest never struck me so forcibly as at present,

“Urchins
Shall, for the vast of night that they may work,
All exercise on thee—”

How can I help bringing to your mind the line—

In the dark backward and abysm of time—

I find I cannot exist without Poetry—without eternal Poetry—half the day will not do—the whole of it—I began with a little, but habit has made me a Leviathan. I had become all in a Tremble from not having written anything of late—the Sonnet overleaf did me good. I slept the better last night for it—this Morning, however, I am nearly as bad again. Just now I opened Spenser, and the first Lines I saw were these—

“The noble heart that harbours virtuous thought,
And is with child of glorious great intent,
Can never rest until it forth have brought
Th’ eternal brood of glory excellent—”

Let me know particularly about Haydon, ask him to write to me about Hunt, if it be only ten lines—I hope all is well—I shall forthwith begin my Endymion, which I hope I shall have got some way with by the time you come, when we will read our verses in a delightful place I have set my heart upon, near the Castle. Give my Love to your Sisters severally—to George and Tom. Remember me to Rice, Mr. and Mrs. Dilke and all we know.

Your sincere Friend
John Keats.

Direct J. Keats, Mrs. Cook’s, New Village, Carisbrooke.





[Pg 10]

IX.—TO LEIGH HUNT.
Margate, May 10, 1817.

My dear Hunt—The little gentleman that sometimes lurks in a gossip’s bowl, ought to have come in the very likeness of a roasted crab, and choaked me outright for not answering your letter ere this: however, you must not suppose that I was in town to receive it: no, it followed me to the Isle of Wight, and I got it just as I was going to pack up for Margate, for reasons which you anon shall hear. On arriving at this treeless affair, I wrote to my brother George to request C. C. C.[14] to do the thing you wot of respecting Rimini; and George tells me he has undertaken it with great pleasure; so I hope there has been an understanding between you for many proofs: C. C. C. is well acquainted with Bensley. Now why did you not send the key of your cupboard, which, I know, was full of papers? We would have locked them all in a trunk, together with those you told me to destroy, which indeed I did not do, for fear of demolishing receipts, there not being a more unpleasant thing in the world (saving a thousand and one others) than to pay a bill twice. Mind you, old Wood’s a “very varmint,” shrouded in covetousness:—and now I am upon a horrid subject—what a horrid one you were upon last Sunday, and well you handled it. The last Examiner[15] was a battering-ram against Christianity, blasphemy, Tertullian, Erasmus, Sir Philip Sidney; and then the dreadful Petzelians and their expiation by blood; and do Christians shudder at the same thing in a newspaper which they attribute to their God in its most aggravated form? What is to be the end of this? I must mention Hazlitt’s Southey.[16] O that he had left[Pg 11] out the grey hairs; or that they had been in any other paper not concluding with such a thunderclap! That sentence about making a page of the feeling of a whole life, appears to me like a whale’s back in the sea of prose. I ought to have said a word on Shakspeare’s Christianity. There are two which I have not looked over with you, touching the thing: the one for, the other against: that in favour is in Measure for Measure, Act II. Scene ii.—

Isab. Alas, alas!
Why, all the souls that were, were forfeit once;
And He that might the ’vantage best have took,
Found out the remedy.

That against is in Twelfth Night, Act III. Scene ii.—

Maria. For there is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness.

Before I come to the Nymphs,[17] I must get through all disagreeables. I went to the Isle of Wight, thought so much about poetry, so long together, that I could not get to sleep at night; and, moreover, I know not how it was, I could not get wholesome food. By this means, in a week or so, I became not over capable in my upper stories, and set off pell-mell for Margate, at least a hundred and fifty miles, because, forsooth, I fancied that I should like my old lodging here, and could contrive to do without trees. Another thing, I was too much in solitude, and consequently was obliged to be in continual burning of thought, as an only resource. However, Tom is with me at present, and we are very comfortable. We intend, though, to get among some trees. How have you got on among them? How are the Nymphs? I suppose they have led you a fine dance. Where are you now?—in Judea, Cappadocia, or the parts of Libya about Cyrene? Stranger from “Heaven, Hues, and Prototypes,” I wager you have given several new turns to the old saying, “Now the maid was fair and pleasant to look on,” as[Pg 12] well as made a little variation in “Once upon a time.” Perhaps, too, you have rather varied, “Here endeth the first lesson.” Thus I hope you have made a horseshoe business of “unsuperfluous life,” “faint bowers,” and fibrous roots. I vow that I have been down in the mouth lately at this work. These last two days, however, I have felt more confident—I have asked myself so often why I should be a poet more than other men, seeing how great a thing it is,—how great things are to be gained by it, what a thing to be in the mouth of Fame,—that at last the idea has grown so monstrously beyond my seeming power of attainment, that the other day I nearly consented with myself to drop into a Phaethon. Yet ’tis a disgrace to fail, even in a huge attempt; and at this moment I drive the thought from me. I began my poem about a fortnight since, and have done some every day, except travelling ones. Perhaps I may have done a good deal for the time, but it appears such a pin’s point to me, that I will not copy any out. When I consider that so many of these pin-points go to form a bodkin-point (God send I end not my life with a bare bodkin, in its modern sense!), and that it requires a thousand bodkins to make a spear bright enough to throw any light to posterity, I see nothing but continual uphill journeying. Now is there anything more unpleasant (it may come among the thousand and one) than to be so journeying and to miss the goal at last? But I intend to whistle all these cogitations into the sea, where I hope they will breed storms violent enough to block up all exit from Russia. Does Shelley go on telling strange stories of the deaths of kings?[18] Tell him, there are strange stories of the deaths of poets. Some have died before they were conceived. “How do you make that out, Master Vellum?” Does Mrs. S. cut bread and butter as neatly[Pg 13] as ever? Tell her to procure some fatal scissors, and cut the thread of life of all to-be-disappointed poets. Does Mrs. Hunt tear linen as straight as ever? Tell her to tear from the book of life all blank leaves. Remember me to them all; to Miss Kent and the little ones all.

Your sincere Friend
John Keats alias Junkets.

You shall hear where we move.





X.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
Margate, Saturday Eve [May 10, 1817].

My dear Haydon,

“Let Fame, that all pant after in their lives,
Live register’d upon our brazen tombs,
And so grace us in the disgrace of death:
When spite of cormorant devouring Time
The endeavour of this present breath may buy
That Honour which shall bate his Scythe’s keen edge
And make us heirs of all eternity.”[19]

To think that I have no right to couple myself with you in this speech would be death to me, so I have e’en written it, and I pray God that our “brazen tombs” be nigh neighbours. It cannot be long first; the “endeavour of this present breath” will soon be over, and yet it is as well to breathe freely during our sojourn—it is as well as if you have not been teased with that Money affair, that bill-pestilence. However, I must think that difficulties nerve the Spirit of a Man—they make our Prime Objects a Refuge as well as a Passion. The Trumpet of Fame is as a tower of Strength, the ambitious bloweth it and is safe. I suppose, by your telling me not to give way to forebodings, George has mentioned to you what I have lately said in my Letters to him—truth is I have been in such a state of Mind as to read over my Lines and hate them. I am one that “gathers Samphire, dreadful trade”—the Cliff of Poesy towers above me—yet when Tom who meets with some of Pope’s[Pg 14] Homer in Plutarch’s Lives reads some of those to me they seem like Mice to mine. I read and write about eight hours a day. There is an old saying “well begun is half done”—’tis a bad one. I would use instead, “Not begun at all till half done;” so according to that I have not begun my Poem and consequently (à priori) can say nothing about it. Thank God! I do begin arduously where I leave off, notwithstanding occasional depressions; and I hope for the support of a High Power while I climb this little eminence, and especially in my Years of more momentous Labour. I remember your saying that you had notions of a good Genius presiding over you. I have of late had the same thought, for things which I do half at Random are afterwards confirmed by my judgment in a dozen features of Propriety. Is it too daring to fancy Shakspeare this Presider? When in the Isle of Wight I met with a Shakspeare in the Passage of the House at which I lodged—it comes nearer to my idea of him than any I have seen—I was but there a Week, yet the old woman made me take it with me though I went off in a hurry. Do you not think this is ominous of good? I am glad you say every man of great views is at times tormented as I am.


Sunday after [May 11].

This Morning I received a letter from George by which it appears that Money Troubles are to follow us up for some time to come—perhaps for always—these vexations are a great hindrance to one—they are not like Envy and detraction stimulants to further exertion as being immediately relative and reflected on at the same time with the prime object—but rather like a nettle leaf or two in your bed. So now I revoke my Promise of finishing my Poem by the Autumn which I should have done had I gone on as I have done—but I cannot write while my spirit is fevered in a contrary direction and I am now sure of having plenty of it this Summer. At this moment I am in no enviable Situation—I feel that[Pg 15] I am not in a Mood to write any to-day; and it appears that the loss of it is the beginning of all sorts of irregularities. I am extremely glad that a time must come when everything will leave not a wrack behind. You tell me never to despair—I wish it was as easy for me to observe the saying—truth is I have a horrid Morbidity of Temperament which has shown itself at intervals—it is I have no doubt the greatest Enemy and stumbling-block I have to fear—I may even say that it is likely to be the cause of my disappointment. However every ill has its share of good—this very bane would at any time enable me to look with an obstinate eye on the Devil Himself—aye to be as proud of being the lowest of the human race as Alfred could be in being of the highest. I feel confident I should have been a rebel angel had the opportunity been mine. I am very sure that you do love me as your very Brother—I have seen it in your continual anxiety for me—and I assure you that your welfare and fame is and will be a chief pleasure to me all my Life. I know no one but you who can be fully sensible of the turmoil and anxiety, the sacrifice of all what is called comfort, the readiness to measure time by what is done and to die in six hours could plans be brought to conclusions—the looking upon the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Earth and its contents, as materials to form greater things—that is to say ethereal things—but here I am talking like a Madman,—greater things than our Creator himself made!!

I wrote to Hunt yesterday—scarcely know what I said in it. I could not talk about Poetry in the way I should have liked for I was not in humor with either his or mine. His self-delusions are very lamentable—they have enticed him into a Situation which I should be less eager after than that of a galley Slave—what you observe thereon is very true must be in time.

Perhaps it is a self-delusion to say so—but I think I could not be deceived in the manner that Hunt is—may I die to-morrow if I am to be. There is no greater[Pg 16] Sin after the seven deadly than to flatter oneself into an idea of being a great Poet—or one of those beings who are privileged to wear out their Lives in the pursuit of Honor—how comfortable a feel it is to feel that such a Crime must bring its heavy Penalty? That if one be a Self-deluder accounts must be balanced? I am glad you are hard at Work—’t will now soon be done—I long to see Wordsworth’s as well as to have mine in:[20] but I would rather not show my face in Town till the end of the Year—if that will be time enough—if not I shall be disappointed if you do not write for me even when you think best. I never quite despair and I read Shakspeare—indeed I shall I think never read any other Book much. Now this might lead me into a long Confab but I desist. I am very near agreeing with Hazlitt that Shakspeare is enough for us. By the by what a tremendous Southean article his last was—I wish he had left out “grey hairs.” It was very gratifying to meet your remarks on the manuscript—I was reading Anthony and Cleopatra when I got the Paper and there are several Passages applicable to the events you commentate. You say that he arrived by degrees and not by any single struggle to the height of his ambition—and that his Life had been as common in particulars as other Men’s. Shakspeare makes Enobarb say—

Where’s Antony?
Eros.—He’s walking in the garden, and spurns
The rush that lies before him; cries, Fool, Lepidus!

In the same scene we find—

Let determined things
To destiny hold unbewailed their way.

Dolabella says of Anthony’s Messenger,

An argument that he is pluck’d when hither
He sends so poor a pinion of his wing.

Then again—

[Pg 17]Eno.—I see Men’s Judgments are
A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward
Do draw the inward quality after them,
To suffer all alike.

The following applies well to Bertrand[21]—

Yet he that can endure
To follow with allegiance a fallen Lord,
Does conquer him that did his Master conquer,
And earns a place i’ the story.

But how differently does Buonaparte bear his fate from Anthony!

’Tis good, too, that the Duke of Wellington has a good Word or so in the Examiner. A Man ought to have the Fame he deserves—and I begin to think that detracting from him as well as from Wordsworth is the same thing. I wish he had a little more taste—and did not in that respect “deal in Lieutenantry.” You should have heard from me before this—but in the first place I did not like to do so before I had got a little way in the First Book, and in the next as G. told me you were going to write I delayed till I had heard from you. Give my Respects the next time you write to the North and also to John Hunt. Remember me to Reynolds and tell him to write. Ay, and when you send Westward tell your Sister that I mentioned her in this. So now in the name of Shakspeare, Raphael and all our Saints, I commend you to the care of heaven!

Your everlasting Friend
John Keats.





XI.—TO MESSRS. TAYLOR AND HESSEY.
Margate, May 16, 1817.

My dear Sirs—I am extremely indebted to you for your liberality in the shape of manufactured rag, value £20, and shall immediately proceed to destroy some of the minor heads of that hydra the dun; to conquer which the knight need have no Sword Shield Cuirass, Cuisses Herbadgeon Spear Casque Greaves Paldrons spurs Chevron[Pg 18] or any other scaly commodity, but he need only take the Bank-note of Faith and Cash of Salvation, and set out against the monster, invoking the aid of no Archimago or Urganda, but finger me the paper, light as the Sibyl’s leaves in Virgil, whereat the fiend skulks off with his tail between his legs. Touch him with this enchanted paper, and he whips you his head away as fast as a snail’s horn—but then the horrid propensity he has to put it up again has discouraged many very valiant Knights. He is such a never-ending still-beginning sort of a body—like my landlady of the Bell. I should conjecture that the very spright that “the green sour ringlets makes Whereof the ewe not bites” had manufactured it of the dew fallen on said sour ringlets. I think I could make a nice little allegorical poem, called “The Dun,” where we would have the Castle of Carelessness, the drawbridge of credit, Sir Novelty Fashion’s expedition against the City of Tailors, etc. etc. I went day by day at my poem for a Month—at the end of which time the other day I found my Brain so over-wrought that I had neither rhyme nor reason in it—so was obliged to give up for a few days. I hope soon to be able to resume my work—I have endeavoured to do so once or twice; but to no purpose. Instead of Poetry, I have a swimming in my head and feel all the effects of a Mental debauch, lowness of Spirits, anxiety to go on without the power to do so, which does not at all tend to my ultimate progression. However to-morrow I will begin my next month. This evening I go to Canterbury, having got tired of Margate. I was not right in my head when I came—At Canterbury I hope the remembrance of Chaucer will set me forward like a Billiard Ball. I am glad to hear of Mr. T.’s health, and of the welfare of the “In-town-stayers.” And think Reynolds will like his Trip—I have some idea of seeing the Continent some time this summer. In repeating how sensible I am of your kindness, I remain

Yr obedt servt and friend
John Keats.

[Pg 19]I shall be happy to hear any little intelligence in the literary or friendly way when you have time to scribble.





XII.—TO MESSRS. TAYLOR AND HESSEY.
[London] Tuesday Morn [July 8, 1817].

My dear Sirs—I must endeavour to lose my maidenhead with respect to money Matters as soon as possible—And I will too—So, here goes! A couple of Duns that I thought would be silent till the beginning, at least, of next month (when I am certain to be on my legs, for certain sure), have opened upon me with a cry most “untuneable”; never did you hear such un-“gallant chiding.” Now you must know, I am not desolate, but have, thank God, 25 good notes in my fob. But then, you know, I laid them by to write with and would stand at bay a fortnight ere they should grab me. In a month’s time I must pay, but it would relieve my mind if I owed you, instead of these Pelican duns.

I am afraid you will say I have “wound about with circumstance,” when I should have asked plainly—however as I said I am a little maidenish or so, and I feel my virginity come strong upon me, the while I request the loan of a £20 and a £10, which, if you would enclose to me, I would acknowledge and save myself a hot forehead. I am sure you are confident of my responsibility, and in the sense of squareness that is always in me.

Your obliged friend
John Keats.





XIII.—TO MARIANE AND JANE REYNOLDS.
[Oxford,[22] September 5, 1817].

My dear Friends—You are I am glad to hear comfortable at Hampton,[23] where I hope you will receive the Biscuits we ate the other night at Little Britain.[24] I hope you found them good. There you are among sands,[Pg 20] stones, Pebbles, Beeches, Cliffs, Rocks, Deeps, Shallows, weeds, ships, Boats (at a distance), Carrots, Turnips, sun, moon, and stars and all those sort of things—here am I among Colleges, halls, Stalls, Plenty of Trees, thank God—Plenty of water, thank heaven—Plenty of Books, thank the Muses—Plenty of Snuff, thank Sir Walter Raleigh—Plenty of segars,—Ditto—Plenty of flat country, thank Tellus’s rolling-pin. I’m on the sofa—Buonaparte is on the snuff-box—But you are by the seaside—argal, you bathe—you walk—you say “how beautiful”—find out resemblances between waves and camels—rocks and dancing-masters—fireshovels and telescopes—Dolphins and Madonas—which word, by the way, I must acquaint you was derived from the Syriac, and came down in a way which neither of you I am sorry to say are at all capable of comprehending. But as a time may come when by your occasional converse with me you may arrive at “something like prophetic strain,” I will unbar the gates of my pride and let my condescension stalk forth like a ghost at the Circus.—The word Ma-don-a, my dear Ladies—or—the word Mad—Ona—so I say! I am not mad—Howsumever when that aged Tamer Kewthon sold a certain camel called Peter to the overseer of the Babel Sky-works, he thus spake, adjusting his cravat round the tip of his chin—“My dear Ten-story-up-in-air! this here Beast, though I say it as shouldn’t say’t, not only has the power of subsisting 40 days and 40 nights without fire and candle but he can sing.—Here I have in my Pocket a Certificate from Signor Nicolini of the King’s Theatre; a Certificate to this effect——” I have had dinner since I left that effect upon you, and feel too heavy in mentibus to display all the Profundity of the Polygon—so you had better each of you take a glass of cherry Brandy and drink to the health of Archimedes, who was of so benign a disposition that he never would leave Syracuse in his life—So kept himself out of all Knight-Errantry.—This I know to be a fact; for it is written in the 45th book of Winkine’s[Pg 21] treatise on garden-rollers, that he trod on a fishwoman’s toe in Liverpool, and never begged her pardon. Now the long and short is this—that is by comparison—for a long day may be a short year—A long Pole may be a very stupid fellow as a man. But let us refresh ourself from this depth of thinking, and turn to some innocent jocularity—the Bow cannot always be bent—nor the gun always loaded, if you ever let it off—and the life of man is like a great Mountain—his breath is like a Shrewsbury cake—he comes into the world like a shoeblack, and goes out of it like a cobbler—he eats like a chimney-sweeper, drinks like a gingerbread baker—and breathes like Achilles—so it being that we are such sublunary creatures, let us endeavour to correct all our bad spelling—all our most delightful abominations, and let us wish health to Marian and Jane, whoever they be and wherever.

Yours truly
John Keats.





XIV—TO FANNY KEATS.
Oxford, September 10 [1817].

My dear Fanny—Let us now begin a regular question and answer—a little pro and con; letting it interfere as a pleasant method of my coming at your favorite little wants and enjoyments, that I may meet them in a way befitting a brother.

We have been so little together since you have been able to reflect on things that I know not whether you prefer the History of King Pepin to Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress—or Cinderella and her glass slipper to Moore’s Almanack. However in a few Letters I hope I shall be able to come at that and adapt my scribblings to your Pleasure. You must tell me about all you read if it be only six Pages in a Week and this transmitted to me every now and then will procure you full sheets of Writing from me pretty frequently.—This I feel as a necessity for we ought to become intimately acquainted, in order that I may not only, as you grow up love you as[Pg 22] my only Sister, but confide in you as my dearest friend. When I saw you last I told you of my intention of going to Oxford and ’tis now a Week since I disembark’d from his Whipship’s Coach the Defiance in this place. I am living in Magdalen Hall on a visit to a young Man with whom I have not been long acquainted, but whom I like very much—we lead very industrious lives—he in general Studies and I in proceeding at a pretty good rate with a Poem which I hope you will see early in the next year.—Perhaps you might like to know what I am writing about. I will tell you. Many Years ago there was a young handsome Shepherd who fed his flocks on a Mountain’s Side called Latmus—he was a very contemplative sort of a Person and lived solitary among the trees and Plains little thinking that such a beautiful Creature as the Moon was growing mad in Love with him.—However so it was; and when he was asleep on the Grass she used to come down from heaven and admire him excessively for a long time; and at last could not refrain from carrying him away in her arms to the top of that high Mountain Latmus while he was a dreaming—but I daresay you have read this and all the other beautiful Tales which have come down from the ancient times of that beautiful Greece. If you have not let me know and I will tell you more at large of others quite as delightful. This Oxford I have no doubt is the finest City in the world—it is full of old Gothic buildings—Spires—towers—Quadrangles—Cloisters—Groves, etc., and is surrounded with more clear streams than ever I saw together. I take a Walk by the Side of one of them every Evening and, thank God, we have not had a drop of rain these many days. I had a long and interesting Letter from George, cross lines by a short one from Tom yesterday dated Paris. They both send their loves to you. Like most Englishmen they feel a mighty preference for everything English—the French Meadows, the trees, the People, the Towns, the Churches, the Books, the everything—although they may be in themselves[Pg 23] good: yet when put in comparison with our green Island they all vanish like Swallows in October. They have seen Cathedrals, Manuscripts, Fountains, Pictures, Tragedy, Comedy,—with other things you may by chance meet with in this Country such as Washerwomen, Lamplighters, Turnpikemen, Fishkettles, Dancing Masters, Kettle drums, Sentry Boxes, Rocking Horses, etc.—and, now they have taken them over a set of boxing-gloves.

I have written to George and requested him, as you wish I should, to write to you. I have been writing very hard lately, even till an utter incapacity came on, and I feel it now about my head: so you must not mind a little out-of-the-way sayings—though by the bye were my brain as clear as a bell I think I should have a little propensity thereto. I shall stop here till I have finished the 3d Book of my Story; which I hope will be accomplish’d in at most three Weeks from to-day—about which time you shall see me. How do you like Miss Taylor’s essays in Rhyme—I just look’d into the Book and it appeared to me suitable to you—especially since I remember your liking for those pleasant little things the Original Poems—the essays are the more mature production of the same hand. While I was speaking about France it occurred to me to speak a few Words on their Language—it is perhaps the poorest one ever spoken since the jabbering in the Tower of Babel, and when you come to know that the real use and greatness of a Tongue is to be referred to its Literature—you will be astonished to find how very inferior it is to our native Speech.—I wish the Italian would supersede French in every school throughout the Country, for that is full of real Poetry and Romance of a kind more fitted for the Pleasure of Ladies than perhaps our own.—It seems that the only end to be gained in acquiring French is the immense accomplishment of speaking it—it is none at all—a most lamentable mistake indeed. Italian indeed would sound most musically from Lips which had began to pronounce it as early as French is crammed down our Mouths, as if we were young Jackdaws[Pg 24] at the mercy of an overfeeding Schoolboy. Now Fanny you must write soon—and write all you think about, never mind what—only let me have a good deal of your writing—You need not do it all at once—be two or three or four days about it, and let it be a diary of your little Life. You will preserve all my Letters and I will secure yours—and thus in the course of time we shall each of us have a good Bundle—which, hereafter, when things may have strangely altered and God knows what happened, we may read over together and look with pleasure on times past—that now are to come. Give my Respects to the Ladies—and so my dear Fanny I am ever

Your most affectionate Brother
John.

If you direct—Post Office, Oxford—your Letter will be brought to me.





XV.—TO JANE REYNOLDS.
Oxford, Sunday Evg. [September 14, 1817].

My dear Jane—You are such a literal translator, that I shall some day amuse myself with looking over some foreign sentences, and imagining how you would render them into English. This is an age for typical Curiosities; and I would advise you, as a good speculation, to study Hebrew, and astonish the world with a figurative version in our native tongue. The Mountains skipping like rams, and the little hills like lambs, you will leave as far behind as the hare did the tortoise. It must be so or you would never have thought that I really meant you would like to pro and con about those Honeycombs—no, I had no such idea, or, if I had, ’twould be only to tease you a little for love. So now let me put down in black and white briefly my sentiments thereon.—Imprimis—I sincerely believe that Imogen is the finest creature, and that I should have been disappointed at hearing you prefer Juliet—Item—Yet I feel such a yearning towards[Pg 25] Juliet that I would rather follow her into Pandemonium than Imogen into Paradise—heartily wishing myself a Romeo to be worthy of her, and to hear the Devils quote the old proverb, “Birds of a feather flock together”—Amen.—

Now let us turn to the Seashore. Believe me, my dear Jane, it is a great happiness to see that you are in this finest part of the year winning a little enjoyment from the hard world. In truth, the great Elements we know of, are no mean comforters: the open sky sits upon our senses like a sapphire crown—the Air is our robe of state—the Earth is our throne, and the Sea a mighty minstrel playing before it—able, like David’s harp, to make such a one as you forget almost the tempest cares of life. I have found in the ocean’s music,—varying (tho self-same) more than the passion of Timotheus, an enjoyment not to be put into words; and, “though inland far I be,” I now hear the voice most audibly while pleasing myself in the idea of your sensations.

—— is getting well apace, and if you have a few trees, and a little harvesting about you, I’ll snap my fingers in Lucifer’s eye. I hope you bathe too—if you do not, I earnestly recommend it. Bathe thrice a week, and let us have no more sitting up next winter. Which is the best of Shakspeare’s plays? I mean in what mood and with what accompaniment do you like the sea best? It is very fine in the morning, when the sun,

“Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
Turns into yellow gold his salt sea streams,”

and superb when

“The sun from meridian height
Illumines the depth of the sea,
And the fishes, beginning to sweat,
Cry d—— it! how hot we shall be,”

and gorgeous, when the fair planet hastens

“To his home
Within the Western foam.”

[Pg 26]But don’t you think there is something extremely fine after sunset, when there are a few white clouds about and a few stars blinking—when the waters are ebbing, and the horizon a mystery? This state of things has been so fulfilling to me that I am anxious to hear whether it is a favourite with you. So when you and Marianne club your letter to me put in a word or two about it. Tell Dilke that it would be perhaps as well if he left a Pheasant or Partridge alive here and there to keep up a supply of game for next season—tell him to rein in if Possible all the Nimrod of his disposition, he being a mighty hunter before the Lord—of the Manor. Tell him to shoot fair, and not to have at the Poor devils in a furrow—when they are flying, he may fire, and nobody will be the wiser.

Give my sincerest respects to Mrs. Dilke, saying that I have not forgiven myself for not having got her the little box of medicine I promised, and that, had I remained at Hampstead I would have made precious havoc with her house and furniture—drawn a great harrow over her garden—poisoned Boxer—eaten her clothes-pegs—fried her cabbages—fricaseed (how is it spelt?) her radishes—ragout’d her Onions—belaboured her beat-root—outstripped her scarlet-runners—parlez-vous’d with her french-beans—devoured her mignon or mignionette—metamorphosed her bell-handles—splintered her looking-glasses—bullocked at her cups and saucers—agonised her decanters—put old Phillips to pickle in the brine-tub—disorganised her piano—dislocated her candlesticks—emptied her wine-bins in a fit of despair—turned out her maid to grass—and astonished Brown; whose letter to her on these events I would rather see than the original Copy of the Book of Genesis. Should you see Mr. W. D.[25] remember me to him, and to little Robinson Crusoe, and to Mr. Snook. Poor Bailey, scarcely ever well,[Pg 27] has gone to bed, pleased that I am writing to you. To your brother John (whom henceforth I shall consider as mine) and to you, my dear friends, Marianne and Jane, I shall ever feel grateful for having made known to me so real a fellow as Bailey. He delights me in the selfish and (please God) the disinterested part of my disposition. If the old Poets have any pleasure in looking down at the enjoyers of their works, their eyes must bend with a double satisfaction upon him. I sit as at a feast when he is over them, and pray that if, after my death, any of my labours should be worth saving, they may have so “honest a chronicler” as Bailey. Out of this, his enthusiasm in his own pursuit and for all good things is of an exalted kind—worthy a more healthful frame and an untorn spirit. He must have happy years to come—“he shall not die by God.”

A letter from John the other day was a chief happiness to me. I made a little mistake when, just now, I talked of being far inland. How can that be when Endymion and I are at the bottom of the sea? whence I hope to bring him in safety before you leave the seaside; and, if I can so contrive it, you shall be greeted by him upon the sea-sands, and he shall tell you all his adventures, which having finished, he shall thus proceed—“My dear Ladies, favourites of my gentle mistress, however my friend Keats may have teased and vexed you, believe me he loves you not the less—for instance, I am deep in his favour, and yet he has been hauling me through the earth and sea with unrelenting perseverance. I know for all this that he is mighty fond of me, by his contriving me all sorts of pleasures. Nor is this the least, fair ladies, this one of meeting you on the desert shore, and greeting you in his name. He sends you moreover this little scroll—” My dear Girls, I send you, per favour of Endymion, the assurance of my esteem for you, and my utmost wishes for your health and pleasure, being ever,

Your affectionate Brother
John Keats.





[Pg 28]

XVI.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
Oxford, Sunday Morn [September 21, 1817].

My dear Reynolds—So you are determined to be my mortal foe—draw a Sword at me, and I will forgive—Put a Bullet in my Brain, and I will shake it out as a dew-drop from the Lion’s Mane—put me on a Gridiron, and I will fry with great complacency—but—oh, horror! to come upon me in the shape of a Dun! Send me bills! as I say to my Tailor, send me Bills and I’ll never employ you more. However, needs must, when the devil drives: and for fear of “before and behind Mr. Honeycomb” I’ll proceed. I have not time to elucidate the forms and shapes of the grass and trees; for, rot it! I forgot to bring my mathematical case with me, which unfortunately contained my triangular Prism so that the hues of the grass cannot be dissected for you—

For these last five or six days, we have had regularly a Boat on the Isis, and explored all the streams about, which are more in number than your eye-lashes. We sometimes skim into a Bed of rushes, and there become naturalised river-folks,—there is one particularly nice nest, which we have christened “Reynolds’s Cove,” in which we have read Wordsworth and talked as may be. I think I see you and Hunt meeting in the Pit.—What a very pleasant fellow he is, if he would give up the sovereignty of a Room pro bono. What Evenings we might pass with him, could we have him from Mrs. H. Failings I am always rather rejoiced to find in a man than sorry for; they bring us to a Level. He has them, but then his makes-up are very good. He agrees with the Northern Poet in this, “He is not one of those who much delight to season their fireside with personal talk”—I must confess however having a little itch that way, and at this present moment I have a few neighbourly remarks to make. The world, and especially our England, has, within the last thirty years, been vexed and teased[Pg 29] by a set of Devils, whom I detest so much that I almost hunger after an Acherontic promotion to a Torturer, purposely for their accommodation. These devils are a set of women, who having taken a snack or Luncheon of Literary scraps, set themselves up for towers of Babel in languages, Sapphos in Poetry, Euclids in Geometry, and everything in nothing. Among such the name of Montague has been pre-eminent. The thing has made a very uncomfortable impression on me. I had longed for some real feminine Modesty in these things, and was therefore gladdened in the extreme on opening the other day, one of Bailey’s Books—a book of poetry written by one beautiful Mrs. Philips, a friend of Jeremy Taylor’s, and called “The Matchless Orinda—” You must have heard of her, and most likely read her Poetry—I wish you have not, that I may have the pleasure of treating you with a few stanzas—I do it at a venture—You will not regret reading them once more. The following, to her friend Mrs. M. A. at parting, you will judge of.

1

I have examin’d and do find,
Of all that favour me
There’s none I grieve to leave behind
But only, only thee.
To part with thee I needs must die,
Could parting sep’rate thee and I.


2

But neither Chance nor Complement
Did element our Love;
’Twas sacred sympathy was lent
Us from the Quire above.
That Friendship Fortune did create,
Still fears a wound from Time or Fate.


3

Our chang’d and mingled Souls are grown
To such acquaintance now,
That if each would resume their own,
Alas! we know not how.
We have each other so engrost,
That each is in the Union lost.

[Pg 30]
4

And thus we can no Absence know,
Nor shall we be confin’d;
Our active Souls will daily go
To learn each others mind.
Nay, should we never meet to Sense,
Our Souls would hold Intelligence.


5

Inspired with a Flame Divine
I scorn to court a stay;
For from that noble Soul of thine
I ne’re can be away.
But I shall weep when thou dost grieve;
Nor can I die whil’st thou dost live.


6

By my own temper I shall guess
At thy felicity,
And only like my happiness
Because it pleaseth thee.
Our hearts at any time will tell
If thou, or I, be sick, or well.


7

All Honour sure I must pretend,
All that is good or great;
She that would be Rosania’s Friend,
Must be at least compleat.[A]
If I have any bravery,
’Tis cause I have so much of thee.


8

Thy Leiger Soul in me shall lie,
And all thy thoughts reveal;
Then back again with mine shall flie,
And thence to me shall steal.
Thus still to one another tend;
Such is the sacred name of Friend.


9

Thus our twin-Souls in one shall grow,
And teach the World new Love,
Redeem the Age and Sex, and show
A Flame Fate dares not move:
And courting Death to be our friend,
Our Lives together too shall end.

[Pg 31]
10

A Dew shall dwell upon our Tomb
Of such a quality,
That fighting Armies, thither come,
Shall reconciled be.
We’ll ask no Epitaph, but say
Orinda and Rosania.

In other of her poems there is a most delicate fancy of the Fletcher kind—which we will con over together. So Haydon is in Town. I had a letter from him yesterday. We will contrive as the winter comes on—but that is neither here nor there. Have you heard from Rice? Has Martin met with the Cumberland Beggar, or been wondering at the old Leech-gatherer? Has he a turn for fossils? that is, is he capable of sinking up to his Middle in a Morass? How is Hazlitt? We were reading his Table[26] last night. I know he thinks him self not estimated by ten people in the world—I wish he knew he is. I am getting on famous with my third Book—have written 800 lines thereof, and hope to finish it next Week. Bailey likes what I have done very much. Believe me, my dear Reynolds, one of my chief layings-up is the pleasure I shall have in showing it to you, I may now say, in a few days. I have heard twice from my Brothers, they are going on very well, and send their Remembrances to you. We expected to have had notices from little-Hampton this morning—we must wait till Tuesday. I am glad of their Days with the Dilkes. You are, I know, very much teased in that precious London, and want all the rest possible; so I shall be contented with as brief a scrawl—a Word or two, till there comes a pat hour.

Send us a few of your stanzas to read in “Reynolds’s Cove.” Give my Love and respects to your Mother, and remember me kindly to all at home.

Yours faithfully
John Keats.

I have left the doublings for Bailey, who is going to say that he will write to you to-morrow.





[Pg 32]

XVII.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
Oxford, September 28 [1817].

My dear Haydon—I read your letter to the young Man, whose Name is Cripps. He seemed more than ever anxious to avail himself of your offer. I think I told you we asked him to ascertain his Means. He does not possess the Philosopher’s stone—nor Fortunatus’s purse, nor Gyges’s ring—but at Bailey’s suggestion, whom I assure you is a very capital fellow, we have stummed up a kind of contrivance whereby he will be enabled to do himself the benefits you will lay in his Path. I have a great Idea that he will be a tolerable neat brush. ’Tis perhaps the finest thing that will befal him this many a year: for he is just of an age to get grounded in bad habits from which you will pluck him. He brought a copy of Mary Queen of Scots: it appears to me that he has copied the bad style of the painting, as well as coloured the eyeballs yellow like the original. He has also the fault that you pointed out to me in Hazlitt on the constringing and diffusing of substance. However I really believe that he will take fire at the sight of your Picture—and set about things. If he can get ready in time to return to town with me, which will be in a few days—I will bring him to you. You will be glad to hear that within these last three weeks I have written 1000 lines—which are the third Book of my Poem. My Ideas with respect to it I assure you are very low—and I would write the subject thoroughly again—but I am tired of it and think the time would be better spent in writing a new Romance which I have in my eye for next summer—Rome was not built in a Day—and all the good I expect from my employment this summer is the fruit of Experience which I hope to gather in my next Poem. Bailey’s kindest wishes, and my vow of being

Yours eternally
John Keats.





[Pg 33]

XVIII.—TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.
Hampstead, Wednesday [October 8, 1817].

My dear Bailey—After a tolerable journey, I went from Coach to Coach as far as Hampstead where I found my Brothers—the next Morning finding myself tolerably well I went to Lamb’s Conduit Street and delivered your parcel. Jane and Marianne were greatly improved. Marianne especially, she has no unhealthy plumpness in the face, but she comes me healthy and angular to the chin—I did not see John—I was extremely sorry to hear that poor Rice, after having had capital health during his tour, was very ill. I daresay you have heard from him. From No. 19 I went to Hunt’s and Haydon’s who live now neighbours.—Shelley was there—I know nothing about anything in this part of the world—every Body seems at Loggerheads. There’s Hunt infatuated—there’s Haydon’s picture in statu quo—There’s Hunt walks up and down his painting room criticising every head most unmercifully. There’s Horace Smith tired of Hunt. “The web of our life is of mingled yarn.”[27] Haydon having removed entirely from Marlborough Street, Cripps must direct his letter to Lisson Grove, North Paddington. Yesterday Morning while I was at Brown’s, in came Reynolds, he was pretty bobbish, we had a pleasant day—he would walk home at night that cursed cold distance. Mrs. Bentley’s children are making a horrid row[28]—whereby I regret I cannot be transported to your Room to write to you. I am quite disgusted with literary men and will never know another except Wordsworth—no not even Byron. Here is an instance of the friendship of such. Haydon and Hunt[Pg 34] have known each other many years—now they live, pour ainsi dire, jealous neighbours—Haydon says to me, Keats, don’t show your lines to Hunt on any Account, or he will have done half for you—so it appears Hunt wishes it to be thought. When he met Reynolds in the Theatre, John told him that I was getting on to the completion of 4000 lines—Ah! says Hunt, had it not been for me they would have been 7000! If he will say this to Reynolds, what would he to other people? Haydon received a Letter a little while back on this subject from some Lady—which contains a caution to me, through him, on the subject—now is not all this a most paltry thing to think about? You may see the whole of the case by the following Extract from a Letter I wrote to George in the Spring—“As to what you say about my being a Poet, I can return no Answer but by saying that the high Idea I have of poetical fame makes me think I see it towering too high above me. At any rate, I have no right to talk until Endymion is finished—it will be a test, a trial of my Powers of Imagination, and chiefly of my invention, which is a rare thing indeed—by which I must make 4000 lines of one bare circumstance, and fill them with poetry: and when I consider that this is a great task, and that when done it will take me but a dozen paces towards the temple of fame—it makes me say—God forbid that I should be without such a task! I have heard Hunt say, and I may be asked—why endeavour after a long Poem? To which I should answer, Do not the Lovers of Poetry like to have a little Region to wander in, where they may pick and choose, and in which the images are so numerous that many are forgotten and found new in a second Reading: which may be food for a Week’s stroll in the Summer? Do not they like this better than what they can read through before Mrs. Williams comes down stairs? a Morning work at most.

“Besides, a long poem is a test of invention, which I take to be the Polar star of Poetry, as Fancy is the Sails—and Imagination the rudder. Did our great Poets[Pg 35] ever write short Pieces? I mean in the shape of Tales—this same invention seems indeed of late years to have been forgotten as a Poetical excellence—But enough of this, I put on no Laurels till I shall have finished Endymion, and I hope Apollo is not angered at my having made a Mockery at him at Hunt’s”——

You see, Bailey, how independent my Writing has been. Hunt’s dissuasion was of no avail—I refused to visit Shelley that I might have my own unfettered scope;—and after all, I shall have the Reputation of Hunt’s élève. His corrections and amputations will by the knowing ones be traced in the Poem. This is, to be sure, the vexation of a day, nor would I say so many words about it to any but those whom I know to have my welfare and reputation at heart. Haydon promised to give directions for those Casts, and you may expect to see them soon, with as many Letters—You will soon hear the dinning of Bells—never mind! you and Gleig[29] will defy the foul fiend—But do not sacrifice your health to Books: do take it kindly and not so voraciously. I am certain if you are your own Physician, your Stomach will resume its proper strength and then what great benefits will follow.—My sister wrote a Letter to me, which I think must be at the post-office—Ax Will to see. My Brother’s kindest remembrances to you—we are going to dine at Brown’s where I have some hopes of meeting Reynolds. The little Mercury I have taken has corrected the poison and improved my health—though I feel from my employment that I shall never be again secure in Robustness. Would that you were as well as

Your Sincere friend and brother
John Keats.





[Pg 36]

XIX.—TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.
[Hampstead: about November 1, 1817.]

My dear Bailey—So you have got a Curacy—good, but I suppose you will be obliged to stop among your Oxford favourites during Term time. Never mind. When do you preach your first sermon?—tell me, for I shall propose to the two R.’s[30] to hear it,—so don’t look into any of the old corner oaken pews, for fear of being put out by us. Poor Johnny Moultrie can’t be there. He is ill, I expect—but that’s neither here nor there. All I can say, I wish him as well through it as I am like to be. For this fortnight I have been confined at Hampstead. Saturday evening was my first day in town, when I went to Rice’s—as we intend to do every Saturday till we know not when. We hit upon an old gent we had known some few years ago, and had a veiry pleasante daye. In this world there is no quiet,—nothing but teasing and snubbing and vexation. My brother Tom looked very unwell yesterday, and I am for shipping him off to Lisbon. Perhaps I ship there with him. I have not seen Mrs. Reynolds since I left you, wherefore my conscience smites me. I think of seeing her to-morrow; have you any message? I hope Gleig came soon after I left. I don’t suppose I’ve written as many lines as you have read volumes, or at least chapters, since I saw you. However, I am in a fair way now to come to a conclusion in at least three weeks, when I assure you I shall be glad to dismount for a month or two; although I’ll keep as tight a rein as possible till then, nor suffer myself to sleep. I will copy for you the opening of the Fourth Book, in which you will see from the manner I had not an opportunity of mentioning any poets, for fear of spoiling the effect of the passage by particularising them.

Thus far had I written when I received your last, which made me at the sight of the direction caper for[Pg 37] despair; but for one thing I am glad that I have been neglectful, and that is, therefrom I have received a proof of your utmost kindness, which at this present I feel very much, and I wish I had a heart always open to such sensations; but there is no altering a man’s nature, and mine must be radically wrong, for it will lie dormant a whole month. This leads me to suppose that there are no men thoroughly wicked, so as never to be self-spiritualised into a kind of sublime misery; but, alas! ’tis but for an hour. He is the only Man “who has kept watch on man’s mortality,” who has philanthropy enough to overcome the disposition to an indolent enjoyment of intellect, who is brave enough to volunteer for uncomfortable hours. You remember in Hazlitt’s essay on commonplace people he says, “they read the Edinburgh and Quarterly, and think as they do.” Now, with respect to Wordsworth’s “Gipsy,” I think he is right, and yet I think Hazlitt is right, and yet I think Wordsworth is rightest. If Wordsworth had not been idle, he had not been without his task; nor had the “Gipsies”—they in the visible world had been as picturesque an object as he in the invisible. The smoke of their fire, their attitudes, their voices, were all in harmony with the evenings. It is a bold thing to say—and I would not say it in print—but it seems to me that if Wordsworth had thought a little deeper at that moment, he would not have written the poem at all. I should judge it to have been written in one of the most comfortable moods of his life—it is a kind of sketchy intellectual landscape, not a search after truth, nor is it fair to attack him on such a subject; for it is with the critic as with the poet; had Hazlitt thought a little deeper, and been in a good temper, he would never have spied out imaginary faults there. The Sunday before last I asked Haydon to dine with me, when I thought of settling all matters with him in regard to Cripps, and let you know about it. Now, although I engaged him a fortnight before, he sent illness as an excuse. He never will come. I have not[Pg 38] been well enough to stand the chance of a wet night, and so have not seen him, nor been able to expurgatorise more masks for you; but I will not speak—your speakers are never doers. Then Reynolds,—every time I see him and mention you, he puts his hand to his head and looks like a son of Niobe’s; but he’ll write soon.

Rome, you know, was not built in a day. I shall be able, by a little perseverance, to read your letters off-hand. I am afraid your health will suffer from over study before your examination. I think you might regulate the thing according to your own pleasure,—and I would too. They were talking of your being up at Christmas. Will it be before you have passed? There is nothing, my dear Bailey, I should rejoice at more than to see you comfortable with a little Peona wife; an affectionate wife, I have a sort of confidence, would do you a great happiness. May that be one of the many blessings I wish you. Let me be but the one-tenth of one to you, and I shall think it great. My brother George’s kindest wishes to you. My dear Bailey, I am,

Your affectionate friend
John Keats.

I should not like to be pages in your way; when in a tolerable hungry mood you have no mercy. Your teeth are the Rock Tarpeian down which you capsize epic poems like mad. I would not for forty shillings be Coleridge’s Lays in your way. I hope you will soon get through this abominable writing in the schools, and be able to keep the terms with more comfort in the hope of retiring to a comfortable and quiet home out of the way of all Hopkinses and black beetles. When you are settled, I will come and take a peep at your church, your house; try whether I shall have grown too lusty for my chair by the fireside, and take a peep at my earliest bower. A question is the best beacon towards a little speculation. Then ask me after my health and spirits. This question ratifies in my mind what I have said above. Health and spirits can only belong unalloyed to the selfish [Pg 39]man—the man who thinks much of his fellows can never be in spirits. You must forgive, although I have only written three hundred lines; they would have been five, but I have been obliged to go to town. Yesterday I called at Lamb’s. St. Jane looked very flush when I first looked in, but was much better before I left.





XX.—TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.
[Fragment from an outside sheet:
postmark London, November 5, 1817.]

... I will speak of something else, or my spleen will get higher and higher—and I am a bearer of the two-edged sword.—I hope you will receive an answer from Haydon soon—if not, Pride! Pride! Pride! I have received no more subscription—but shall soon have a full health, Liberty and leisure to give a good part of my time to him. I will certainly be in time for him. We have promised him one year: let that have elapsed, then do as we think proper. If I did not know how impossible it is, I should say—“do not at this time of disappointments, disturb yourself about others.”

There has been a flaming attack upon Hunt in the Endinburgh Magazine. I never read anything so virulent—accusing him of the greatest Crimes, depreciating his Wife, his Poetry, his Habits, his Company, his Conversation. These Philippics are to come out in numbers—called “the Cockney School of Poetry.” There has been but one number published—that on Hunt—to which they have prefixed a motto from one Cornelius Webb Poetaster—who unfortunately was of our party occasionally at Hampstead and took it into his head to write the following,—something about “we’ll talk on Wordsworth, Byron, a theme we never tire on;” and so forth till he comes to Hunt and Keats. In the Motto they have put Hunt and Keats in large letters—I have no doubt that the second number was intended for me: but have hopes of its non-appearance, from the[Pg 40] following Advertisement in last Sunday’s Examiner:—“To Z.—The Writer of the Article signed Z., in Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine for October 1817 is invited to send his address to the printer of the Examiner, in order that Justice may be Executed on the proper person.” I don’t mind the thing much—but if he should go to such lengths with me as he has done with Hunt, I must infallibly call him to an Account if he be a human being, and appears in Squares and Theatres, where we might possibly meet—I don’t relish his abuse....





XXI.—TO CHARLES WENTWORTH DILKE.
[Hampstead, November 1817.]

My dear Dilke—Mrs. Dilke or Mr. Wm. Dilke, whoever of you shall receive this present, have the kindness to send pr. bearer Sibylline Leaves, and your petitioner shall ever pray as in duty bound.

Given under my hand this Wednesday morning of Novr. 1817.

John Keats.

Vivant Rex et Regina—amen.





XXII.—TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.
[Burford Bridge, November 22, 1817.]

My dear Bailey—I will get over the first part of this (unsaid[31]) Letter as soon as possible, for it relates to the affairs of poor Cripps.—To a Man of your nature such a Letter as Haydon’s must have been extremely cutting—What occasions the greater part of the World’s Quarrels?—simply this—two Minds meet, and do not understand each other time enough to prevent any shock or surprise at the conduct of either party—As soon as I had known Haydon three days, I had got enough of his Character not to have been surprised at such a Letter as he has hurt you[Pg 41] with. Nor, when I knew it, was it a principle with me to drop his acquaintance; although with you it would have been an imperious feeling. I wish you knew all that I think about Genius and the Heart—and yet I think that you are thoroughly acquainted with my innermost breast in that respect, or you could not have known me even thus long, and still hold me worthy to be your dear Friend. In passing, however, I must say one thing that has pressed upon me lately, and increased my Humility and capability of submission—and that is this truth—Men of Genius are great as certain ethereal Chemicals operating on the Mass of neutral intellect—but they have not any individuality, any determined Character—I would call the top and head of those who have a proper self Men of Power.

But I am running my head into a subject which I am certain I could not do justice to under five Years’ study, and 3 vols. octavo—and, moreover, I long to be talking about the Imagination—so my dear Bailey, do not think of this unpleasant affair, if possible do not—I defy any harm to come of it—I defy. I shall write to Cripps this week, and request him to tell me all his goings-on from time to time by Letter wherever I may be. It will go on well—so don’t because you have suddenly discovered a Coldness in Haydon suffer yourself to be teased—Do not my dear fellow—O! I wish I was as certain of the end of all your troubles as that of your momentary start about the authenticity of the Imagination. I am certain of nothing but of the holiness of the Heart’s affections, and the truth of Imagination. What the Imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth—whether it existed before or not,—for I have the same idea of all our passions as of Love: they are all, in their sublime, creative of essential Beauty. In a Word, you may know my favourite speculation by my first Book, and the little Song I sent in my last, which is a representation from the fancy of the probable mode of operating in these Matters. The Imagination may be compared to Adam’s dream,—he[Pg 42] awoke and found it truth:[32]—I am more zealous in this affair, because I have never yet been able to perceive how anything can be known for truth by consecutive reasoning—and yet it must be. Can it be that even the greatest Philosopher ever arrived at his Goal without putting aside numerous objections? However it may be, O for a life of Sensations rather than of Thoughts! It is “a Vision in the form of Youth,” a shadow of reality to come—And this consideration has further convinced me,—for it has come as auxiliary to another favourite speculation of mine,—that we shall enjoy ourselves hereafter by having what we called happiness on Earth repeated in a finer tone—And yet such a fate can only befall those who delight in Sensation, rather than hunger as you do after Truth. Adam’s dream will do here, and seems to be a Conviction that Imagination and its empyreal reflection, is the same as human life and its spiritual repetition. But, as I was saying, the Simple imaginative Mind may have its rewards in the repetition of its own silent Working coming continually on the Spirit with a fine Suddenness—to compare great things with small, have you never by being surprised with an old Melody, in a delicious place by a delicious voice, felt over again your very speculations and surmises at the time it first operated on your soul?—do you not remember forming to yourself the Singer’s face—more beautiful than it was possible, and yet with the elevation of the Moment you did not think so? Even then you were mounted on the Wings of Imagination, so high that the prototype must be hereafter—that delicious face you will see. What a time! I am continually running away from the subject. Sure this cannot[Pg 43] be exactly the Case with a complex mind—one that is imaginative, and at the same time careful of its fruits,—who would exist partly on Sensation, partly on thought—to whom it is necessary that years should bring the philosophic Mind? Such a one I consider yours, and therefore it is necessary to your eternal happiness that you not only drink this old Wine of Heaven, which I shall call the redigestion of our most ethereal Musings upon Earth, but also increase in knowledge and know all things. I am glad to hear that you are in a fair way for Easter. You will soon get through your unpleasant reading, and then!—but the world is full of troubles, and I have not much reason to think myself pestered with many.

I think Jane or Marianne has a better opinion of me than I deserve: for, really and truly, I do not think my Brother’s illness connected with mine—you know more of the real Cause than they do; nor have I any chance of being rack’d as you have been. You perhaps at one time thought there was such a thing as worldly happiness to be arrived at, at certain periods of time marked out,—you have of necessity from your disposition been thus led away—I scarcely remember counting upon any Happiness—I look not for it if it be not in the present hour,—nothing startles me beyond the moment. The Setting Sun will always set me to rights, or if a Sparrow come before my Window, I take part in its existence and pick about the gravel. The first thing that strikes me on hearing a Misfortune having befallen another is this—“Well, it cannot be helped: he will have the pleasure of trying the resources of his Spirit”—and I beg now, my dear Bailey, that hereafter should you observe anything cold in me not to put it to the account of heartlessness, but abstraction—for I assure you I sometimes feel not the influence of a passion or affection during a whole Week—and so long this sometimes continues, I begin to suspect myself, and the genuineness of my feelings at other times—thinking them a few barren Tragedy Tears.

My brother Tom is much improved—he is going to[Pg 44] Devonshire—whither I shall follow him. At present, I am just arrived at Dorking—to change the Scene—change the Air, and give me a spur to wind up my Poem, of which there are wanting 500 lines. I should have been here a day sooner, but the Reynoldses persuaded me to stop in Town to meet your friend Christie. There were Rice and Martin—we talked about Ghosts. I will have some Talk with Taylor and let you know,—when please God I come down at Christmas. I will find that Examiner if possible. My best regards to Gleig, my Brothers’ to you and Mrs. Bentley.

Your affectionate Friend
John Keats.

I want to say much more to you—a few hints will set me going. Direct Burford Bridge near Dorking.





XXIII.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
[Burford Bridge,] November 22, 1817.

My dear Reynolds—There are two things which tease me here—one of them Cripps, and the other that I cannot go with Tom into Devonshire. However, I hope to do my duty to myself in a week or so; and then I’ll try what I can do for my neighbour—now, is not this virtuous? On returning to Town I’ll damm all Idleness—indeed, in superabundance of employment, I must not be content to run here and there on little two-penny errands, but turn Rakehell, i.e. go a masking, or Bailey will think me just as great a Promise Keeper as he thinks you; for myself I do not, and do not remember above one complaint against you for matter o’ that. Bailey writes so abominable a hand, to give his Letter a fair reading requires a little time: so I had not seen, when I saw you last, his invitation to Oxford at Christmas. I’ll go with you. You know how poorly Rice was. I do not think it was all corporeal,—bodily pain was not used to keep him silent. I’ll tell you what; he was hurt at what your Sisters said about his joking with your Mother, he was,[Pg 45] soothly to sain. It will all blow over. God knows, my dear Reynolds, I should not talk any sorrow to you—you must have enough vexations—so I won’t any more. If I ever start a rueful subject in a letter to you—blow me! Why don’t you?—now I am going to ask you a very silly Question neither you nor anybody else could answer, under a folio, or at least a Pamphlet—you shall judge—why don’t you, as I do, look unconcerned at what may be called more particularly Heart-vexations? They never surprise me—lord! a man should have the fine point of his soul taken off to become fit for this world.

I like this place very much. There is Hill and Dale and a little River. I went up Box hill this Evening after the Moon—“you a’ seen the Moon”—came down, and wrote some lines. Whenever I am separated from you, and not engaged in a continued Poem, every letter shall bring you a lyric—but I am too anxious for you to enjoy the whole to send you a particle. One of the three books I have with me is Shakspeare’s Poems: I never found so many beauties in the sonnets—they seem to be full of fine things said unintentionally—in the intensity of working out conceits. Is this to be borne? Hark ye!

When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
Which erst from heat did canopy the head,
And Summer’s green all girded up in sheaves,
Borne on the bier with white and bristly head.

He has left nothing to say about nothing or anything: for look at snails—you know what he says about Snails—you know when he talks about “cockled Snails”—well, in one of these sonnets, he says—the chap slips into—no! I lie! this is in the Venus and Adonis: the simile brought it to my Mind.

As the snail, whose tender horns being hit,
Shrinks back into his shelly cave with pain,
And there all smothered up in shade doth sit,
Long after fearing to put forth again;
So at his bloody view her eyes are fled,
Into the deep dark Cabins of her head.

[Pg 46]He overwhelms a genuine Lover of poesy with all manner of abuse, talking about—

“a poet’s rage
And stretched metre of an antique song.”

Which, by the bye, will be a capital motto for my poem, won’t it? He speaks too of “Time’s antique pen”—and “April’s first-born flowers”—and “Death’s eternal cold.”—By the Whim-King! I’ll give you a stanza, because it is not material in connection, and when I wrote it I wanted you—to give your vote, pro or con.—

Crystalline Brother of the belt of Heaven,
Aquarius! to whom King Jove hath given
Two liquid pulse-streams, ’stead of feather’d wings—
Two fan-like fountains—thine illuminings
For Dian play:
Dissolve the frozen purity of air;
Let thy white shoulders, silvery and bare,
Show cold through wat’ry pinions: make more bright
The Star-Queen’s Crescent on her marriage night:
Haste, haste away!

... I see there is an advertisement in the Chronicle to Poets—he is so over-loaded with poems on the “late Princess.” I suppose you do not lack—send me a few—lend me thy hand to laugh a little—send me a little pullet-sperm, a few finch-eggs—and remember me to each of our card-playing Club. When you die you will all be turned into Dice, and be put in pawn with the devil: for cards, they crumple up like anything....

I rest Your affectionate friend
John Keats.

Give my love to both houses—hinc atque illinc.





XXIV.—TO GEORGE AND THOMAS KEATS.
Hampstead, December 22, 1817.

My dear Brothers—I must crave your pardon for not having written ere this.... I saw Kean return to the public in Richard III., and finely he did it, and, at the request of Reynolds, I went to criticise his Duke in[Pg 47] Richd.—the critique is in to-day’s Champion, which I send you with the Examiner, in which you will find very proper lamentation on the obsoletion of Christmas Gambols and pastimes: but it was mixed up with so much egotism of that drivelling nature that pleasure is entirely lost. Hone the publisher’s trial, you must find very amusing, and as Englishmen very encouraging: his Not Guilty is a thing, which not to have been, would have dulled still more Liberty’s Emblazoning—Lord Ellenborough has been paid in his own coin—Wooler and Hone have done us an essential service. I have had two very pleasant evenings with Dilke yesterday and to-day, and am at this moment just come from him, and feel in the humour to go on with this, begun in the morning, and from which he came to fetch me. I spent Friday evening with Wells[33] and went next morning to see Death on the Pale horse. It is a wonderful picture, when West’s age is considered; but there is nothing to be intense upon, no women one feels mad to kiss, no face swelling into reality. The excellence of every art is its intensity, capable of making all disagreeables evaporate from their being in close relationship with Beauty and Truth—Examine King Lear, and you will find this exemplified throughout; but in this picture we have unpleasantness without any momentous depth of speculation excited, in which to bury its repulsiveness—The picture is larger than Christ rejected.

I dined with Haydon the Sunday after you left, and had a very pleasant day, I dined too (for I have been out too much lately) with Horace Smith and met his two Brothers with Hill and Kingston and one Du Bois, they only served to convince me how superior humour is to wit, in respect to enjoyment—These men say things which make one start, without making one feel, they are[Pg 48] all alike; their manners are alike; they all know fashionables; they have all a mannerism in their very eating and drinking, in their mere handling a Decanter. They talked of Kean and his low company—would I were with that company instead of yours said I to myself! I know such like acquaintance will never do for me and yet I am going to Reynolds, on Wednesday. Brown and Dilke walked with me and back from the Christmas pantomime. I had not a dispute, but a disquisition, with Dilke upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, and at once it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and which Shakspeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason. Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery,[34] from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.

Shelley’s poem[35] is out and there are words about its being objected to, as much as Queen Mab was. Poor Shelley I think he has his Quota of good qualities, in sooth la! Write soon to your most sincere friend and affectionate Brother

John.





XXV.—TO GEORGE AND THOMAS KEATS.
Featherstone Buildings,[36] Monday [January 5, 1818].

My dear Brothers—I ought to have written before, and you should have had a long letter last week, but I[Pg 49] undertook the Champion for Reynolds, who is at Exeter. I wrote two articles, one on the Drury Lane Pantomime, the other on the Covent Garden new Tragedy, which they have not put in;[37] the one they have inserted is so badly punctuated that you perceive I am determined never to write more, without some care in that particular. Wells tells me that you are licking your chops, Tom, in expectation of my book coming out. I am sorry to say I have not begun my corrections yet: to-morrow I set out. I called on Sawrey[38] this morning. He did not seem to be at all put out at anything I said and the inquiries I made with regard to your spitting of blood, and moreover desired me to ask you to send him a correct account of all your sensations and symptoms concerning the palpitation and the spitting and the cough—if you have any. Your last letter gave me a great pleasure, for I think the invalid is in a better spirit there along the Edge; and as for George, I must immediately, now I think of it, correct a little misconception of a part of my last letter. The Misses Reynolds have never said one word against me about you, or by any means endeavoured to lessen you in my estimation. That is not what I referred to; but the manner and thoughts which I knew they internally had towards you, time will show. Wells and Severn dined with me yesterday. We had a very pleasant day. I pitched upon another bottle of claret, we enjoyed ourselves very much; were all very witty and full of Rhymes. We played a concert from 4 o’clock till 10—drank your healths, the Hunts’, and (N.B.) seven Peter Pindars. I said on that day the only good thing I was ever guilty of. We were talking about Stephens and the 1st Gallery. I said I wondered that careful folks would go there, for although it was but a shilling, still you had to pay through the Nose. I saw the Peachey family in a box at Drury one night. I have[Pg 50] got such a curious[39] ... or rather I had such, now I am in my own hand.

I have had a great deal of pleasant time with Rice lately, and am getting initiated into a little band. They call drinking deep dyin’ scarlet. They call good wine a pretty tipple, and call getting a child knocking out an apple; stopping at a tavern they call hanging out. Where do you sup? is where do you hang out?

Thursday I promised to dine with Wordsworth, and the weather is so bad that I am undecided, for he lives at Mortimer Street. I had an invitation to meet him at Kingston’s,[40] but not liking that place I sent my excuse. What I think of doing to-day is to dine in Mortimer Street (Wordsth), and sup here in the Feaths buildings, as Mr. Wells has invited me. On Saturday, I called on Wordsworth before he went to Kingston’s, and was surprised to find him with a stiff collar. I saw his spouse, and I think his daughter. I forget whether I had written my last before my Sunday evening at Haydon’s—no, I did not, or I should have told you, Tom, of a young man you met at Paris, at Scott’s, ... Ritchie. I think he is going to Fezan, in Africa; then to proceed if possible like Mungo Park. He was very polite to me, and inquired very particularly after you. Then there was Wordsworth, Lamb, Monkhouse, Landseer, Kingston, and your humble servant. Lamb got tipsy and blew up Kingston—proceeding so far as to take the candle across the room, hold it to his face, and show us what a soft fellow he was.[41] I astonished Kingston at supper with a[Pg 51] pertinacity in favour of drinking, keeping my two glasses at work in a knowing way.

I have seen Fanny twice lately—she inquired particularly after you and wants a co-partnership letter from you. She has been unwell, but is improving. I think she will be quick. Mrs. Abbey was saying that the Keatses were ever indolent, that they would ever be so, and that it is born in them. Well, whispered Fanny to me, if it is born with us, how can we help it? She seems very anxious for a letter. As I asked her what I should get for her, she said a “Medal of the Princess.” I called on Haslam—we dined very snugly together. He sent me a Hare last week, which I sent to Mrs. Dilke. Brown is not come back. I and Dilke are getting capital friends. He is going to take the Champion. He has sent his farce to Covent Garden. I met Bob Harris[42] on the steps at Covent Garden; we had a good deal of curious chat. He came out with his old humble opinion. The Covent Garden pantomime is a very nice one, but they have a middling Harlequin, a bad Pantaloon, a worse Clown, and a shocking Columbine, who is one of the Miss Dennets. I suppose you will see my critique on the new tragedy in the next week’s Champion. It is a shocking bad one. I have not seen Hunt; he was out when I called. Mrs. Hunt looks as well as ever I saw her after her confinement. There is an article in the se’nnight Examiner on Godwin’s Mandeville, signed E. K.—I think it Miss Kent’s—I will send it. There are fine subscriptions going on for Hone.

You ask me what degrees there are between Scott’s novels and those of Smollett. They appear to me to be quite distinct in every particular, more especially in their aims. Scott endeavours to throw so interesting and romantic a colouring into common and low characters as to give them a touch of the sublime. Smollett on the contrary pulls down and levels what with other men[Pg 52] would continue romance. The grand parts of Scott are within the reach of more minds than the finest humours in Humphrey Clinker. I forget whether that fine thing of the Serjeant is Fielding or Smollett, but it gives me more pleasure than the whole novel of the Antiquary. You must remember what I mean. Some one says to the Serjeant: “That’s a non-sequitur!”—“If you come to that,” replies the Serjeant, “you’re another!”—

I see by Wells’s letter Mr. Abbey[43] does not overstock you with money. You must write. I have not seen ... yet, but expect it on Wednesday. I am afraid it is gone. Severn tells me he has an order for some drawings for the Emperor of Russia.

You must get well Tom, and then I shall feel whole and genial as the winter air. Give me as many letters as you like, and write to Sawrey soon. I received a short letter from Bailey about Cripps, and one from Haydon, ditto. Haydon thinks he improved very much. Mrs. Wells desires particularly ... to Tom and her respects to George, and I desire no better than to be ever your most affectionate Brother

John.

P.S.—I had not opened the Champion before I found both my articles in it.

I was at a dance at Redhall’s, and passed a pleasant time enough—drank deep, and won 10.6 at cutting for half guineas.... Bailey was there and seemed to enjoy the evening. Rice said he cared less about the hour than any one, and the proof is his dancing—he cares not for time, dancing as if he was deaf. Old Redhall not being used to give parties, had no idea of the quantity of wine that would be drank, and he actually put in readiness on the kitchen stairs eight dozen.

Every one inquires after you, and desires their remembrances to you.

Your Brother
John.





[Pg 53]

XXVI.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
[Hampstead,] Saturday Morn [January 10, 1818].

My dear Haydon—I should have seen you ere this, but on account of my sister being in Town: so that when I have sometimes made ten paces towards you, Fanny has called me into the City; and the Christmas Holydays are your only time to see Sisters, that is if they are so situated as mine. I will be with you early next week—to-night it should be, but we have a sort of a Club every Saturday evening—to-morrow, but I have on that day an insuperable engagement. Cripps has been down to me, and appears sensible that a binding to you would be of the greatest advantage to him—if such a thing be done it cannot be before £150 or £200 are secured in subscriptions to him. I will write to Bailey about it, give a Copy of the Subscribers’ names to every one I know who is likely to get a £5 for him. I will leave a Copy at Taylor and Hessey’s, Rodwell and Martin, and will ask Kingston and Co. to cash up.

Your friendship for me is now getting into its teens—and I feel the past. Also every day older I get—the greater is my idea of your achievements in Art: and I am convinced that there are three things to rejoice at in this Age—The Excursion, Your Pictures, and Hazlitt’s depth of Taste.

Yours affectionately
John Keats.





XXVII.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
[Hampstead,] Saturday Morning [January 10, 1818].

My dear Taylor—Several things have kept me from you lately:—first you had got into a little hell, which I was not anxious to reconnoitre—secondly, I have made a vow not to call again without my first book: so you may expect to see me in four days. Thirdly, I have been racketing too much, and do not feel over well. I[Pg 54] have seen Wordsworth frequently—Dined with him last Monday—Reynolds, I suppose you have seen. Just scribble me thus many lines, to let me know you are in the land of the living, and well. Remember me to the Fleet Street Household—and should you see any from Percy Street, give my kindest regards to them.

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





XXVIII.—TO GEORGE AND THOMAS KEATS.
[Hampstead,] Tuesday [January 13, 1818].

My dear Brothers—I am certain I think of having a letter to-morrow morning for I expected one so much this morning, having been in town two days, at the end of which my expectations began to get up a little. I found two on the table, one from Bailey and one from Haydon, I am quite perplexed in a world of doubts and fancies—there is nothing stable in the world; uproar’s your only music—I don’t mean to include Bailey in this and so dismiss him from this with all the opprobrium he deserves—that is in so many words, he is one of the noblest men alive at the present day. In a note to Haydon about a week ago (which I wrote with a full sense of what he had done, and how he had never manifested any little mean drawback in his value of me) I said if there were three things superior in the modern world, they were “the Excursion,” “Haydon’s pictures,” and “Hazlitt’s depth of Taste”—so I do believe—Not thus speaking with any poor vanity that works of genius were the first things in this world. No! for that sort of probity and disinterestedness which such men as Bailey possess, does hold and grasp the tiptop of any spiritual honours that can be paid to anything in this world—And moreover having this feeling at this present come over me in its full force, I sat down to write to you with a grateful heart, in that I had not a Brother who did not feel and credit me for a deeper feeling and devotion for[Pg 55] his uprightness, than for any marks of genius however splendid. I was speaking about doubts and fancies—I mean there has been a quarrel of a severe nature between Haydon and Reynolds and another (“the Devil rides upon a fiddlestick”) between Hunt and Haydon—the first grew from the Sunday on which Haydon invited some friends to meet Wordsworth. Reynolds never went, and never sent any Notice about it, this offended Haydon more than it ought to have done—he wrote a very sharp and high note to Reynolds and then another in palliation—but which Reynolds feels as an aggravation of the first—Considering all things, Haydon’s frequent neglect of his Appointments, etc. his notes were bad enough to put Reynolds on the right side of the question—but then Reynolds has no power of sufferance; no idea of having the thing against him; so he answered Haydon in one of the most cutting letters I ever read; exposing to himself all his own weaknesses and going on to an excess, which whether it is just or no, is what I would fain have unsaid, the fact is, they are both in the right and both in the wrong.

The quarrel with Hunt I understand thus far. Mrs. H. was in the habit of borrowing silver of Haydon—the last time she did so, Haydon asked her to return it at a certain time—she did not—Haydon sent for it—Hunt went to expostulate on the indelicacy, etc.—they got to words and parted for ever. All I hope is at some time to bring them together again.—Lawk! Molly there’s been such doings—Yesterday evening I made an appointment with Wells to go to a private theatre, and it being in the neighbourhood of Drury Lane, and thinking we might be fatigued with sitting the whole evening in one dirty hole, I got the Drury Lane ticket, and therewith we divided the evening with a spice of Richard III——


[Later, January 19 or 20.]

Good Lord! I began this letter nearly a week ago, what have I been doing since—I have been—I mean[Pg 56] not been—sending last Sunday’s paper to you. I believe because it was not near me—for I cannot find it, and my conscience presses heavy on me for not sending it. You would have had one last Thursday, but I was called away, and have been about somewhere ever since. Where? What! Well I rejoice almost that I have not heard from you because no news is good news. I cannot for the world recollect why I was called away, all I know is that there has been a dance at Dilke’s, and another at the London Coffee House; to both of which I went. But I must tell you in another letter the circumstances thereof—for though a week should have passed since I wrote on the other side it quite appals me. I can only write in scraps and patches. Brown is returned from Hampstead. Haydon has returned an answer in the same style—they are all dreadfully irritated against each other. On Sunday I saw Hunt and dined with Haydon, met Hazlitt and Bewick there, and took Haslam with me—forgot to speak about Cripps though I broke my engagement to Haslam’s on purpose. Mem.—Haslam came to meet me, found me at Breakfast, had the goodness to go with me my way—I have just finished the revision of my first book, and shall take it to Taylor’s to-morrow—intend to persevere—Do not let me see many days pass without hearing from you.

Your most affectionate Brother
John.





XXIX.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
[Hampstead,] Friday 23d [January 1818].

My dear Taylor—I have spoken to Haydon about the drawing. He would do it with all his Art and Heart too, if so I will it; however, he has written thus to me; but I must tell you, first, he intends painting a finished Picture from the Poem. Thus he writes—“When I do anything for your Poem it must be effectual—an honour to both of us: to hurry up a sketch for the season won’t do. I think an engraving from your head, from a Chalk[Pg 57] drawing of mine, done with all my might, to which I would put my name, would answer Taylor’s idea better than the other. Indeed, I am sure of it. This I will do, and this will be effectual, and as I have not done it for any other human being, it will have an effect.”

What think you of this? Let me hear. I shall have my second Book in readiness forthwith.

Yours most sincerely
John Keats.

If Reynolds calls tell him three lines will be acceptable, for I am squat at Hampstead.





XXX.—TO GEORGE AND THOMAS KEATS.
[Hampstead,] Friday 23d January [1818].

My dear Brothers—I was thinking what hindered me from writing so long, for I have so many things to say to you, and know not where to begin. It shall be upon a thing most interesting to you, my Poem. Well! I have given the first Book to Taylor; he seemed more than satisfied with it, and to my surprise proposed publishing it in Quarto if Haydon would make a drawing of some event therein, for a Frontispiece. I called on Haydon, he said he would do anything I liked, but said he would rather paint a finished picture, from it, which he seems eager to do; this in a year or two will be a glorious thing for us; and it will be, for Haydon is struck with the 1st Book. I left Haydon and the next day received a letter from him, proposing to make, as he says, with all his might, a finished chalk sketch of my head, to be engraved in the first style and put at the head of my Poem, saying at the same time he had never done the thing for any human being, and that it must have considerable effect as he will put his name to it—I begin to-day to copy my 2nd Book—“thus far into the bowels of the land”—You shall hear whether it will be Quarto or non Quarto, picture or non picture. Leigh Hunt I showed my 1st Book to—he[Pg 58] allows it not much merit as a whole; says it is unnatural and made ten objections to it in the mere skimming over. He says the conversation is unnatural and too high-flown for Brother and Sister—says it should be simple forgetting do ye mind that they are both overshadowed by a supernatural Power, and of force could not speak like Francesca in the Rimini. He must first prove that Caliban’s poetry is unnatural—This with me completely overturns his objections—the fact is he and Shelley are hurt, and perhaps justly, at my not having showed them the affair officiously and from several hints I have had they appear much disposed to dissect and anatomise any trip or slip I may have made.—But who’s afraid? Ay! Tom! Demme if I am. I went last Tuesday, an hour too late, to Hazlitt’s Lecture on poetry, got there just as they were coming out, when all these pounced upon me. Hazlitt, John Hunt and Son, Wells, Bewick, all the Landseers, Bob Harris, aye and more—the Landseers enquired after you particularly—I know not whether Wordsworth has left town—But Sunday I dined with Hazlitt and Haydon, also that I took Haslam with me—I dined with Brown lately. Dilke having taken the Champion Theatricals was obliged to be in town—Fanny has returned to Walthamstow.—Mr. Abbey appeared very glum, the last time I went to see her, and said in an indirect way, that I had no business there—Rice has been ill, but has been mending much lately—

I think a little change has taken place in my intellect lately—I cannot bear to be uninterested or unemployed, I, who for so long a time have been addicted to passiveness. Nothing is finer for the purposes of great productions than a very gradual ripening of the intellectual powers. As an instance of this—observe—I sat down yesterday to read King Lear once again: the thing appeared to demand the prologue of a sonnet, I wrote it, and began to read—(I know you would like to see it.)

[Pg 59]

ON SITTING DOWN TO KING LEAR ONCE AGAIN.

O golden-tongued Romance with serene Lute!
Fair-plumed Syren, Queen of far-away!
Leave melodising on this wintry day,
Shut up thine olden volume and be mute.
Adieu! for once again the fierce dispute
Betwixt Hell torment and impassion’d Clay
Must I burn through; once more assay
The bitter sweet of this Shakspearian fruit.
Chief Poet! and ye clouds of Albion,
Begetters of our deep eternal theme,
When I am through the old oak forest gone
Let me not wander in a barren dream,
But, when I am consumed with the Fire,
Give me new Phœnix-wings to fly at my desire.

So you see I am getting at it, with a sort of determination and strength, though verily I do not feel it at this moment—this is my fourth letter this morning, and I feel rather tired, and my head rather swimming—so I will leave it open till to-morrow’s post.—

I am in the habit of taking my papers to Dilke’s and copying there; so I chat and proceed at the same time. I have been there at my work this evening, and the walk over the Heath takes off all sleep, so I will even proceed with you. I left off short in my last just as I began an account of a private theatrical—Well it was of the lowest order, all greasy and oily, insomuch that if they had lived in olden times, when signs were hung over the doors, the only appropriate one for that oily place would have been—a guttered Candle. They played John Bull, The Review, and it was to conclude with Bombastes Furioso—I saw from a Box the first Act of John Bull, then went to Drury and did not return till it was over—when by Wells’s interest we got behind the scenes—there was not a yard wide all the way round for actors, scene-shifters, and interlopers to move in—for ‘Nota Bene’ the Green Room was under the stage, and there was I threatened over and over again to be turned out by the oily scene-shifters, there did I hear a little painted[Pg 60] Trollop own, very candidly, that she had failed in Mary, with a “damn’d if she’d play a serious part again, as long as she lived,” and at the same time she was habited as the Quaker in the Review.—There was a quarrel, and a fat good-natured looking girl in soldiers’ clothes wished she had only been a man for Tom’s sake. One fellow began a song, but an unlucky finger-point from the Gallery sent him off like a shot. One chap was dressed to kill for the King in Bombastes, and he stood at the edge of the scene in the very sweat of anxiety to show himself, but Alas the thing was not played. The sweetest morsel of the night moreover was, that the musicians began pegging and fagging away—at an overture—never did you see faces more in earnest, three times did they play it over, dropping all kinds of corrections and still did not the curtain go up. Well then they went into a country dance, then into a region they well knew, into the old boonsome Pothouse, and then to see how pompous o’ the sudden they turned; how they looked about and chatted; how they did not care a damn; was a great treat——

I hope I have not tired you by this filling up of the dash in my last. Constable the bookseller has offered Reynolds ten guineas a sheet to write for his Magazine—it is an Edinburgh one, which Blackwood’s started up in opposition to. Hunt said he was nearly sure that the ‘Cockney School’ was written by Scott[44] so you are right Tom!—There are no more little bits of news I can remember at present.

I remain, My dear Brothers, Your very affectionate Brother
John.





[Pg 61]

XXXI.—TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.
[Hampstead,] Friday Jany. 23 [1818].

My dear Bailey—Twelve days have pass’d since your last reached me.—What has gone through the myriads of human minds since the 12th? We talk of the immense Number of Books, the Volumes ranged thousands by thousands—but perhaps more goes through the human intelligence in Twelve days than ever was written.—How has that unfortunate family lived through the twelve? One saying of yours I shall never forget—you may not recollect it—it being perhaps said when you were looking on the Surface and seeming of Humanity alone, without a thought of the past or the future—or the deeps of good and evil—you were at that moment estranged from speculation, and I think you have arguments ready for the Man who would utter it to you—this is a formidable preface for a simple thing—merely you said, “Why should woman suffer?” Aye, why should she? “By heavens I’d coin my very Soul, and drop my Blood for Drachmas!” These things are, and he, who feels how incompetent the most skyey Knight-errantry is to heal this bruised fairness, is like a sensitive leaf on the hot hand of thought.—Your tearing, my dear friend, a spiritless and gloomy letter up, to re-write to me, is what I shall never forget—it was to me a real thing—Things have happened lately of great perplexity—you must have heard of them—Reynolds and Haydon retorting and recriminating—and parting for ever—the same thing has happened between Haydon and Hunt. It is unfortunate—Men should bear with each other: there lives not the Man who may not be cut up, aye Lashed to pieces on his weakest side. The best of Men have but a portion of good in them—a kind of spiritual yeast in their frames, which creates the ferment of existence—by which a Man is propelled to act, and strive, and buffet with Circumstance. The sure way, Bailey, is first to[Pg 62] know a Man’s faults, and then be passive—if after that he insensibly draws you towards him then you have no power to break the link. Before I felt interested in either Reynolds or Haydon, I was well read in their faults; yet, knowing them, I have been cementing gradually with both. I have an affection for them both, for reasons almost opposite—and to both must I of necessity cling, supported always by the hope that, when a little time, a few years, shall have tried me more fully in their esteem, I may be able to bring them together. The time must come, because they have both hearts: and they will recollect the best parts of each other, when this gust is overblown.—I had a message from you through a letter to Jane—I think, about Cripps—there can be no idea of binding until a sufficient sum is sure for him—and even then the thing should be maturely considered by all his helpers—I shall try my luck upon as many fat purses as I can meet with.—Cripps is improving very fast: I have the greater hopes of him because he is so slow in development. A Man of great executing powers at 20, with a look and a speech almost stupid, is sure to do something.

I have just looked through the Second Side of your Letter—I feel a great content at it.—I was at Hunt’s the other day, and he surprised me with a real authenticated lock of Milton’s Hair. I know you would like what I wrote thereon, so here it is—as they say of a Sheep in a Nursery Book:—

ON SEEING A LOCK OF MILTON’S HAIR.

Chief of Organic Numbers!
Old Scholar of the Spheres!
Thy spirit never slumbers,
But rolls about our ears
For ever, and for ever!
O what a mad endeavour
Worketh he,
Who to thy sacred and ennobled hearse
Would offer a burnt sacrifice of verse
[Pg 63]And melody.

How heavenward thou soundest,
Live Temple of sweet noise,
And Discord unconfoundest,
Giving Delight new joys,
And Pleasure nobler pinions!
O, where are thy dominions?
Lend thine ear
To a young Delian oath,—aye, by thy soul,
By all that from thy mortal lips did roll,
And by the kernel of thine earthly love,
Beauty, in things on earth, and things above,
I swear!
When every childish fashion
Has vanish’d from my rhyme,
Will I, gray-gone in passion,
Leave to an after-time,
Hymning and harmony
Of thee, and of thy works, and of thy life;
But vain is now the burning and the strife,
Pangs are in vain, until I grow high-rife
With old Philosophy,
And mad with glimpses of futurity!

For many years my offering must be hush’d;
When I do speak, I’ll think upon this hour,
Because I feel my forehead hot and flush’d,
Even at the simplest vassal of thy power,—
A lock of thy bright hair,—
Sudden it came,
And I was startled, when I caught thy name
Coupled so unaware;
Yet, at the moment, temperate was my blood.
I thought I had beheld it from the flood.

This I did at Hunt’s at his request—perhaps I should have done something better alone and at home.—I have sent my first Book to the press, and this afternoon shall begin preparing the Second—my visit to you will be a great spur to quicken the proceeding.—I have not had your Sermon returned—I long to make it the Subject of a Letter to you—What do they say at Oxford?

I trust you and Gleig pass much fine time together. Remember me to him and Whitehead. My Brother Tom is getting stronger, but his spitting of Blood continues. I sat down to read King Lear yesterday, and felt the[Pg 64] greatness of the thing up to the Writing of a Sonnet preparatory thereto—in my next you shall have it.—There were some miserable reports of Rice’s health—I went, and lo! Master Jemmy had been to the play the night before, and was out at the time—he always comes on his legs like a Cat. I have seen a good deal of Wordsworth. Hazlitt is lecturing on Poetry at the Surrey Institution—I shall be there next Tuesday.

Your most affectionate friend
John Keats.





XXXII.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
[Hampstead, January 30, 1818.]

My dear Taylor—These lines as they now stand about “happiness,” have rung in my ears like “a chime a mending”—See here,

“Behold
Wherein lies happiness, Peona? fold, etc.”

It appears to me the very contrary of blessed. I hope this will appear to you more eligible.

“Wherein lies Happiness? In that which becks
Our ready minds to fellowship divine,
A fellowship with Essence till we shine
Full alchemised, and free of space—Behold
The clear religion of Heaven—fold, etc.”

You must indulge me by putting this in, for setting aside the badness of the other, such a preface is necessary to the subject. The whole thing must, I think, have appeared to you, who are a consecutive man, as a thing almost of mere words, but I assure you that, when I wrote it, it was a regular stepping of the Imagination towards a truth. My having written that argument will perhaps be of the greatest service to me of anything I ever did. It set before me the gradations of happiness, even like a kind of pleasure thermometer, and is my first step towards the chief attempt in the drama. The playing of different natures with joy and [Pg 65]Sorrow—Do me this favour, and believe me

Your sincere friend
J. Keats.

I hope your next work will be of a more general Interest. I suppose you cogitate a little about it, now and then.





XXXIII.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
Hampstead, Saturday [January 31, 1818].

My dear Reynolds—I have parcelled out this day for Letter Writing—more resolved thereon because your Letter will come as a refreshment and will have (sic parvis etc.) the same effect as a Kiss in certain situations where people become over-generous. I have read this first sentence over, and think it savours rather; however an inward innocence is like a nested dove, as the old song says....

Now I purposed to write to you a serious poetical letter, but I find that a maxim I met with the other day is a just one: “On cause míeux quand on ne dit pas causons.” I was hindered, however, from my first intention by a mere muslin Handkerchief very neatly pinned—but “Hence, vain deluding,” etc. Yet I cannot write in prose; it is a sunshiny day and I cannot, so here goes,—

Hence Burgundy, Claret, and Port,
Away with old Hock and Madeira,
Too earthly ye are for my sport;
There’s a beverage brighter and clearer.
Instead of a pitiful rummer,
My wine overbrims a whole summer;
My bowl is the sky,
And I drink at my eye,
Till I feel in the brain
A Delphian pain—
Then follow, my Caius! then follow:
On the green of the hill
We will drink our fill
Of golden sunshine,
Till our brains intertwine
With the glory and grace of Apollo!
[Pg 66]
God of the Meridian,
And of the East and West,
To thee my soul is flown,
And my body is earthward press’d.—
It is an awful mission,
A terrible division;
And leaves a gulph austere
To be fill’d with worldly fear.
Aye, when the soul is fled
Too high above our head,
Affrighted do we gaze
After its airy maze,
As doth a mother wild,
When her young infant child
Is in an eagle’s claws—
And is not this the cause
Of madness?—God of Song,
Thou bearest me along
Through sights I scarce can bear:
O let me, let me share
With the hot lyre and thee,
The staid Philosophy.
Temper my lonely hours,
And let me see thy bowers
More unalarm’d!

My dear Reynolds, you must forgive all this ranting—but the fact is, I cannot write sense this Morning—however you shall have some—I will copy out my last Sonnet.

When I have fears that I may cease to be
Before my pen has glean’d my teeming brain,
Before high piled Books in charactery,
Hold like rich garners the full ripen’d grain—
When I behold, upon the night’s starr’d face,
Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,
And think that I may never live to trace
Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,
That I shall never look upon thee more,
Never have relish in the faery power
Of unreflecting Love;—then on the shore
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think
Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.

[Pg 67]I must take a turn, and then write to Teignmouth. Remember me to all, not excepting yourself.

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





XXXIV.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
Hampstead, Tuesday [February 3, 1818].

My dear Reynolds—I thank you for your dish of Filberts—would I could get a basket of them by way of dessert every day for the sum of twopence.[45] Would we were a sort of ethereal Pigs, and turned loose to feed upon spiritual Mast and Acorns—which would be merely being a squirrel and feeding upon filberts, for what is a squirrel but an airy pig, or a filbert but a sort of archangelical acorn? About the nuts being worth cracking, all I can say is, that where there are a throng of delightful Images ready drawn, simplicity is the only thing. The first is the best on account of the first line, and the “arrow, foil’d of its antler’d food,” and moreover (and this is the only word or two I find fault with, the more because I have had so much reason to shun it as a quicksand) the last has “tender and true.” We must cut this, and not be rattlesnaked into any more of the like. It may be said that we ought to read our contemporaries, that Wordsworth, etc., should have their due from us. But, for the sake of a few fine imaginative or domestic passages, are we to be bullied into a certain Philosophy engendered in the whims of an Egotist? Every man has his speculations, but every man does not brood and peacock over them till he makes a false coinage and deceives himself. Many a man can travel to the very bourne of Heaven, and yet want confidence to put down his half-seeing. Sancho will invent a Journey heavenward[Pg 68] as well as anybody. We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us, and, if we do not agree, seems to put its hand into its breeches pocket. Poetry should be great and unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one’s soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself—but with its subject. How beautiful are the retired flowers!—how would they lose their beauty were they to throng into the highway, crying out, “Admire me, I am a violet! Dote upon me, I am a primrose!” Modern poets differ from the Elizabethans in this: each of the moderns like an Elector of Hanover governs his petty state and knows how many straws are swept daily from the Causeways in all his dominions, and has a continual itching that all the Housewives should have their coppers well scoured: The ancients were Emperors of vast Provinces, they had only heard of the remote ones and scarcely cared to visit them. I will cut all this—I will have no more of Wordsworth or Hunt in particular—Why should we be of the tribe of Manasseh, when we can wander with Esau? Why should we kick against the Pricks, when we can walk on Roses? Why should we be owls, when we can be eagles? Why be teased with “nice-eyed wagtails,” when we have in sight “the Cherub Contemplation”? Why with Wordsworth’s “Matthew with a bough of wilding in his hand,” when we can have Jacques “under an oak,” etc.? The secret of the Bough of Wilding will run through your head faster than I can write it. Old Matthew spoke to him some years ago on some nothing, and because he happens in an Evening Walk to imagine the figure of the old Man, he must stamp it down in black and white, and it is henceforth sacred. I don’t mean to deny Wordsworth’s grandeur and Hunt’s merit, but I mean to say we need not be teased with grandeur and merit when we can have them uncontaminated and unobtrusive. Let us have the old Poets and Robin Hood. Your letter and its sonnets gave me more pleasure than will the Fourth Book of Childe Harold and the whole of anybody’s life and opinions.[Pg 69] In return for your Dish of Filberts, I have gathered a few Catkins, I hope they’ll look pretty.

TO J. H. R. IN ANSWER TO HIS ROBIN HOOD SONNETS.

No! those days are gone away,
And their hours are old and gray,
And their minutes buried all
Under the down-trodden pall
Of the leaves of many years.
Many times have Winter’s shears,
Frozen North and chilling East,
Sounded tempests to the feast
Of the forest’s whispering fleeces,
Since men paid no rent on Leases.
No! the Bugle sounds no more,
And the twanging bow no more;
Silent is the ivory shrill
Past the heath and up the Hill;
There is no mid-forest laugh,
Where lone Echo gives the half
To some wight amaz’d to hear
Jesting, deep in forest drear.
On the fairest time of June
You may go with Sun or Moon,
Or the seven stars to light you,
Or the polar ray to right you;
But you never may behold
Little John or Robin bold;
Never any of all the clan,
Thrumming on an empty can
Some old hunting ditty, while
He doth his green way beguile
To fair Hostess Merriment
Down beside the pasture Trent,
For he left the merry tale,
Messenger for spicy ale.
Gone the merry morris din,
Gone the song of Gamelyn,
Gone the tough-belted outlaw
Idling in the “grenè shawe”:
All are gone away and past!
And if Robin should be cast
Sudden from his turfed grave,
And if Marian should have
Once again her forest days,
[Pg 70]She would weep, and he would craze:
He would swear, for all his oaks,
Fall’n beneath the Dock-yard strokes,
Have rotted on the briny seas;
She would weep that her wild bees
Sang not to her—“strange that honey
Can’t be got without hard money!”

So it is! yet let us sing,
Honour to the old bow-string,
Honour to the bugle-horn,
Honour to the woods unshorn,
Honour to the Lincoln green,
Honour to the archer keen,
Honour to tight little John,
And the horse he rode upon:
Honour to bold Robin Hood,
Sleeping in the underwood!
Honour to maid Marian,
And to all the Sherwood clan—
Though their days have hurried by
Let us two a burden try.

I hope you will like them—they are at least written in the Spirit of Outlawry. Here are the Mermaid lines,

Souls of Poets dead and gone,
What Elysium have ye known,
Happy field, or mossy cavern,
Fairer than the Mermaid Tavern?
Have ye tippled drink more fine
Than mine Host’s Canary wine?
Or are fruits of paradise
Sweeter than those dainty pies
Of Venison? O generous food
Drest as though bold Robin Hood
Would with his Maid Marian,
Sup and bowse from horn and can.
I have heard that, on a day,
Mine host’s sign-board flew away,
No body knew whither, till
An astrologer’s old Quill
To a sheepskin gave the story,
Said he saw you in your glory,
Underneath a new old-sign
Sipping beverage divine,
And pledging with contented smack,
[Pg 71]The Mermaid in the Zodiac.
Souls of Poets dead and gone,
Are the winds a sweeter home?
Richer is uncellar’d cavern,
Than the merry mermaid Tavern?[46]

I will call on you at 4 to-morrow, and we will trudge together, for it is not the thing to be a stranger in the Land of Harpsicols. I hope also to bring you my 2nd Book. In the hope that these Scribblings will be some amusement for you this Evening, I remain, copying on the Hill,

Your sincere friend and Co-scribbler
John Keats.





XXXV.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
Fleet Street, Thursday Morn [February 5, 1818].

My dear Taylor—I have finished copying my Second Book—but I want it for one day to overlook it. And moreover this day I have very particular employ in the affair of Cripps—so I trespass on your indulgence, and take advantage of your good nature. You shall hear from me or see me soon. I will tell Reynolds of your engagement to-morrow.

Yours unfeignedly
John Keats.





XXXVI.—TO GEORGE AND THOMAS KEATS.
Hampstead, Saturday Night [February 14, 1818].

My dear Brothers—When once a man delays a letter beyond the proper time, he delays it longer, for one or two reasons—first, because he must begin in a very common-place style, that is to say, with an excuse; and secondly things and circumstances become so jumbled in his mind, that he knows not what, or what not, he has said in his last—I shall visit you as soon as I have copied my poem all out, I am now much beforehand with the printer, they have done none yet, and I am[Pg 72] half afraid they will let half the season by before the printing. I am determined they shall not trouble me when I have copied it all.—Horace Smith has lent me his manuscript called “Nehemiah Muggs, an exposure of the Methodists”—perhaps I may send you a few extracts—Hazlitt’s last Lecture was on Thomson, Cowper, and Crabbe, he praised Thomson and Cowper but he gave Crabbe an unmerciful licking—I think Hunt’s article of Fazio—no it was not, but I saw Fazio the first night, it hung rather heavily on me—I am in the high way of being introduced to a squad of people, Peter Pindar, Mrs. Opie, Mrs. Scott—Mr. Robinson a great friend of Coleridge’s called on me.[47] Richards tells me that my poems are known in the west country, and that he saw a very clever copy of verses, headed with a Motto from my Sonnet to George—Honours rush so thickly upon me that I shall not be able to bear up against them. What think you—am I to be crowned in the Capitol, am I to be made a Mandarin—No! I am to be invited, Mrs. Hunt tells me, to a party at Ollier’s, to keep Shakspeare’s birthday—Shakspeare would stare to see me there.[48] The Wednesday before last Shelley, Hunt and I wrote each a Sonnet on the River Nile, some day you shall read them all. I saw a sheet of Endymion, and have all reason to suppose they will soon get it done, there shall be nothing wanting on my part. I have been writing at intervals many songs and Sonnets, and I long to be at Teignmouth, to read them over to you: however I think I had better wait till this Book is off my mind; it will not be long first.

Reynolds has been writing two very capital articles, in the Yellow Dwarf, on popular Preachers—All the talk here is about Dr. Croft the Duke of Devon etc.

Your most affectionate Brother
John.

XXXVII.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
[Hampstead, February 19, 1818.]

My dear Reynolds—I had an idea that a Man might pass a very pleasant life in this manner—Let him on a certain day read a certain page of full Poesy or distilled Prose, and let him wander with it, and muse upon it, and reflect from it, and bring home to it, and prophesy upon it, and dream upon it: until it becomes stale—But when will it do so? Never—When Man has arrived at a certain ripeness in intellect any one grand and spiritual passage serves him as a starting-post towards all “the two-and-thirty Palaces.” How happy is such a voyage of conception, what delicious diligent indolence! A doze upon a sofa does not hinder it, and a nap upon Clover engenders ethereal finger-pointings—the prattle of a child gives it wings, and the converse of middle-age a strength to beat them—a strain of music conducts to “an odd angle of the Isle,” and when the leaves whisper it puts a girdle round the earth.—Nor will this sparing touch of noble Books be any irreverence to their Writers—for perhaps the honors paid by Man to Man are trifles in comparison to the benefit done by great works to the “spirit and pulse of good” by their mere passive existence. Memory should not be called Knowledge—Many have original minds who do not think it—they are led away by Custom. Now it appears to me that almost any Man may like the spider spin from his own inwards his own airy Citadel—the points of leaves and twigs on which the spider begins her work are few, and she fills the air with a beautiful circuiting. Man should be content with as few points to tip with the fine Web of his Soul, and weave a tapestry empyrean—full of symbols for his spiritual eye, of softness for his spiritual touch, of space for his wandering, of distinctness for his luxury. But the minds of mortals are so different and bent on such diverse journeys that it may at first appear impossible for any[Pg 74] common taste and fellowship to exist between two or three under these suppositions. It is however quite the contrary. Minds would leave each other in contrary directions, traverse each other in numberless points, and at last greet each other at the journey’s end. An old man and a child would talk together and the old man be led on his path and the child left thinking. Man should not dispute or assert, but whisper results to his Neighbour, and thus by every germ of spirit sucking the sap from mould ethereal every human might become great, and humanity instead of being a wide heath of furze and briars, with here and there a remote Oak or Pine, would become a grand democracy of forest trees. It has been an old comparison for our urging on—the beehive—however it seems to me that we should rather be the flower than the Bee—for it is a false notion that more is gained by receiving than giving—no, the receiver and the giver are equal in their benefits. The flower, I doubt not, receives a fair guerdon from the Bee—its leaves blush deeper in the next spring—and who shall say between Man and Woman which is the most delighted? Now it is more noble to sit like Jove than to fly like Mercury:—let us not therefore go hurrying about and collecting honey, bee-like, buzzing here and there impatiently from a knowledge of what is to be arrived at. But let us open our leaves like a flower, and be passive and receptive; budding patiently under the eye of Apollo and taking hints from every noble insect that favours us with a visit—Sap will be given us for meat, and dew for drink. I was led into these thoughts, my dear Reynolds, by the beauty of the morning operating on a sense of Idleness. I have not read any Books—the Morning said I was right—I had no idea but of the Morning, and the Thrush said I was right—seeming to say,

“O thou whose face hath felt the Winter’s wind,
Whose eye has seen the snow-clouds hung in Mist,
[Pg 75]And the black Elmtops ’mong the freezing stars:
To thee the Spring will be a harvest-time—
O thou, whose only book has been the light
Of supreme darkness which thou feddest on
Night after night, when Phœbus was away,
To thee the Spring shall be a triple morn—
O fret not after knowledge—I have none,
And yet my song comes native with the warmth.
O fret not after knowledge—I have none,
And yet the Evening listens. He who saddens
At thought of idleness cannot be idle,
And he’s awake who thinks himself asleep.”

Now I am sensible all this is a mere sophistication (however it may neighbour to any truths), to excuse my own indolence—So I will not deceive myself that Man should be equal with Jove—but think himself very well off as a sort of scullion-Mercury or even a humble-bee. It is no matter whether I am right or wrong either one way or another, if there is sufficient to lift a little time from your shoulders—

Your affectionate friend
John Keats.





XXXVIII.—TO GEORGE AND THOMAS KEATS.
Hampstead, Saturday [February 21, 1818].

My dear Brothers—I am extremely sorry to have given you so much uneasiness by not writing; however, you know good news is no news or vice versâ. I do not like to write a short letter to you, or you would have had one long before. The weather although boisterous to-day has been very much milder; and I think Devonshire is not the last place to receive a temperate Change. I have been abominably idle since you left, but have just turned over a new leaf, and used as a marker a letter of excuse to an invitation from Horace Smith. The occasion of my writing to-day is the enclosed letter—by Postmark from Miss W——[49] Does she expect you in town George? I received a letter the other day from Haydon, in which he says, his Essays on the Elgin Marbles are being translated into Italian, the which he superintends. I did not[Pg 76] mention that I had seen the British Gallery, there are some nice things by Stark, and Bathsheba by Wilkie, which is condemned. I could not bear Alston’s Uriel.

Reynolds has been very ill for some time, confined to the house, and had leeches applied to his chest; when I saw him on Wednesday he was much the same, and he is in the worst place for amendment, among the strife of women’s tongues, in a hot and parch’d room: I wish he would move to Butler’s for a short time. The Thrushes and Blackbirds have been singing me into an idea that it was Spring, and almost that leaves were on the trees. So that black clouds and boisterous winds seem to have mustered and collected in full Divan, for the purpose of convincing me to the contrary. Taylor says my poem shall be out in a month, I think he will be out before it....

The thrushes are singing now as if they would speak to the winds, because their big brother Jack, the Spring, was not far off. I am reading Voltaire and Gibbon, although I wrote to Reynolds the other day to prove reading of no use; I have not seen Hunt since, I am a good deal with Dilke and Brown, we are very thick; they are very kind to me, they are well. I don’t think I could stop in Hampstead but for their neighbourhood. I hear Hazlitt’s lectures regularly, his last was on Gray, Collins, Young, etc., and he gave a very fine piece of discriminating Criticism on Swift, Voltaire, and Rabelais. I was very disappointed at his treatment of Chatterton. I generally meet with many I know there. Lord Byron’s 4th Canto is expected out, and I heard somewhere, that Walter Scott has a new Poem in readiness. I am sorry that Wordsworth has left a bad impression wherever he visited in town by his egotism, Vanity, and bigotry. Yet he is a great poet if not a philosopher. I have not yet read Shelley’s Poem, I do not suppose you have it yet, at the Teignmouth libraries. These double letters must come rather heavy, I hope you have a moderate portion of cash, but don’t fret at all, if you have not—Lord! I intend to play at[Pg 77] cut and run as well as Falstaff, that is to say, before he got so lusty.

I remain praying for your health my dear Brothers

Your affectionate Brother
John.





XXXIX.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
Hampstead, February 27 [1818].

My dear Taylor—Your alteration strikes me as being a great Improvement—And now I will attend to the punctuations you speak of—The comma should be at soberly, and in the other passage, the Comma should follow quiet. I am extremely indebted to you for this alteration, and also for your after admonitions. It is a sorry thing for me that any one should have to overcome prejudices in reading my verses—that affects me more than any hypercriticism on any particular passage—In Endymion, I have most likely but moved into the go-cart from the leading-strings—In poetry I have a few axioms, and you will see how far I am from their centre.

1st. I think poetry should surprise by a fine excess, and not by singularity; It should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost a remembrance.

2d. Its touches of beauty should never be half-way, thereby making the reader breathless, instead of content. The rise, the progress, the setting of Imagery should, like the sun, come natural to him, shine over him, and set soberly, although in magnificence, leaving him in the luxury of twilight. But it is easier to think what poetry should be, than to write it—And this leads me to

Another axiom—That if poetry comes not as naturally as the leaves to a tree, it had better not come at all.—However it may be with me, I cannot help looking into new countries with “O for a Muse of Fire to ascend!” If Endymion serves me as a pioneer, perhaps I ought to be content—I have great reason to be content, for thank God I can read, and perhaps understand [Pg 78]Shakspeare to his depths; and I have I am sure many friends, who, if I fail, will attribute any change in my life and temper to humbleness rather than pride—to a cowering under the wings of great poets, rather than to a bitterness that I am not appreciated. I am anxious to get Endymion printed that I may forget it and proceed. I have copied the 3rd Book and begun the 4th. On running my eye over the proofs, I saw one mistake—I will notice it presently, and also any others, if there be any. There should be no comma in “the raft branch down sweeping from a tall ash-top.” I have besides made one or two alterations, and also altered the thirteenth line p. 32 to make sense of it, as you will see. I will take care the printer shall not trip up my heels. There should be no dash after Dryope, in the line “Dryope’s lone lulling of her child.”

Remember me to Percy Street.

Your sincere and obliged friend
John Keats.

P.S.—You shall have a short preface in good time.





XL.—TO MESSRS. TAYLOR AND HESSEY.
[Hampstead, March 1818?]

My dear Sirs—I am this morning making a general clearance of all lent Books—all—I am afraid I do not return all—I must fog your memories about them—however with many thanks here are the remainder—which I am afraid are not worth so much now as they were six months ago—I mean the fashions may have changed—

Yours truly
John Keats.





XLI.—TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.
Teignmouth, Friday [March 13, 1818].[50]

My dear Bailey—When a poor devil is drowning, it is said he comes thrice to the surface ere he makes his[Pg 79] final sink—if however even at the third rise he can manage to catch hold of a piece of weed or rock he stands a fair chance, as I hope I do now, of being saved. I have sunk twice in our correspondence, have risen twice, and have been too idle, or something worse, to extricate myself. I have sunk the third time, and just now risen again at this two of the Clock p.m., and saved myself from utter perdition by beginning this, all drenched as I am, and fresh from the water. And I would rather endure the present inconvenience of a wet jacket than you should keep a laced one in store for me. Why did I not stop at Oxford in my way? How can you ask such a Question? Why, did I not promise to do so? Did I not in a letter to you make a promise to do so? Then how can you be so unreasonable as to ask me why I did not? This is the thing—(for I have been rubbing up my Invention—trying several sleights—I first polished a cold, felt it in my fingers, tried it on the table, but could not pocket it:—I tried Chillblains, Rheumatism, Gout, tight boots,—nothing of that sort would do,—so this is, as I was going to say, the thing)—I had a letter from Tom, saying how much better he had got, and thinking he had better stop—I went down to prevent his coming up. Will not this do? turn it which way you like—it is selvaged all round. I have used it, these three last days, to keep out the abominable Devonshire weather—by the by, you may say what you will of Devonshire: the truth is, it is a splashy, rainy, misty, snowy, foggy, haily, floody, muddy, slipshod county. The hills are very beautiful, when you get a sight of ’em—the primroses are out, but then you are in—the Cliffs are of a fine deep colour, but then the Clouds are continually vieing with them—the Women like your London people in a sort of negative way—because the native men are the poorest creatures in England—because Government never have thought it worth while to send a recruiting party among them. When I think of Wordsworth’s sonnet “Vanguard of Liberty! ye men of Kent!”[Pg 80] the degenerated race about me are Pulvis ipecac. simplex—a strong dose. Were I a corsair, I’d make a descent on the south coast of Devon; if I did not run the chance of having Cowardice imputed to me. As for the men, they’d run away into the Methodist meeting-houses, and the women would be glad of it. Had England been a large Devonshire, we should not have won the Battle of Waterloo. There are knotted oaks—there are lusty rivulets? there are meadows such as are not—there are valleys of feminine[51] climate—but there are no thews and sinews—Moore’s Almanack is here a Curiosity—Arms, neck, and shoulders may at least be seen there, and the ladies read it as some out-of-the-way Romance. Such a quelling Power have these thoughts over me that I fancy the very air of a deteriorating quality. I fancy the flowers, all precocious, have an Acrasian spell about them—I feel able to beat off the Devonshire waves like soapfroth. I think it well for the honour of Britain that Julius Cæsar did not first land in this County. A Devonshirer standing on his native hills is not a distinct object—he does not show against the light—a wolf or two would dispossess him. I like, I love England. I like its living men—give me a long brown plain “for my morning,”[51] so I may meet with some of Edmund Ironside’s descendants. Give me a barren mould, so I may meet with some shadowing of Alfred in the shape of a Gipsy, a huntsman or a shepherd. Scenery is fine—but human nature is finer—the sward is richer for the tread of a real nervous English foot—the Eagle’s nest is finer, for the Mountaineer has looked into it. Are these facts or prejudices? Whatever they be, for them I shall never be able to relish entirely any Devonshire scenery—Homer is fine, Achilles is fine, Diomed is fine, Shakspeare is fine, Hamlet is fine, Lear is fine, but dwindled Englishmen are not fine. Where too the women are so passable, and have such English names, such as Ophelia, Cordelia etc. that they should have such Paramours or rather Imparamours—As for[Pg 81] them, I cannot in thought help wishing, as did the cruel Emperor, that they had but one head, and I might cut it off to deliver them from any horrible Courtesy they may do their undeserving countrymen, I wonder I meet with no born monsters—O Devonshire, last night I thought the moon had dwindled in heaven——

I have never had your Sermon from Wordsworth, but Mr. Dilke lent it me. You know my ideas about Religion. I do not think myself more in the right than other people, and that nothing in this world is proveable. I wish I could enter into all your feelings on the subject, merely for one short 10 minutes, and give you a page or two to your liking. I am sometimes so very sceptical as to think Poetry itself a mere Jack o’ Lantern to amuse whoever may chance to be struck with its brilliance. As tradesmen say everything is worth what it will fetch, so probably every mental pursuit takes its reality and worth from the ardour of the pursuer—being in itself a Nothing. Ethereal things may at least be thus real, divided under three heads—Things real—things semireal—and nothings. Things real, such as existences of Sun moon and Stars—and passages of Shakspeare.—Things semireal, such as love, the Clouds etc., which require a greeting of the Spirit to make them wholly exist—and Nothings, which are made great and dignified by an ardent pursuit—which, by the by, stamp the Burgundy mark on the bottles of our minds, insomuch as they are able to “consecrate whate’er they look upon.” I have written a sonnet here of a somewhat collateral nature—so don’t imagine it an “apropos des bottes”—

Four Seasons fill the measure of the year;
There are four seasons in the mind of Man:
He hath his lusty Spring, when Fancy clear
Takes in all beauty with an easy span:
He has his Summer, when luxuriously
He chews the honied cud of fair Spring thoughts,
Till in his Soul, dissolv’d, they come to be
[Pg 82]Part of himself: He hath his Autumn Ports
And havens of repose, when his tired wings
Are folded up, and he content to look[52]
On Mists in idleness—to let fair things
Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook.
He has his winter too of Pale misfeature,
Or else he would forego his mortal nature.

Aye, this may be carried—but what am I talking of?—it is an old maxim of mine, and of course must be well known, that every point of thought is the Centre of an intellectual world. The two uppermost thoughts in a Man’s mind are the two poles of his world—he revolves on them, and everything is Southward or Northward to him through their means.—We take but three steps from feathers to iron.—Now, my dear fellow, I must once for all tell you I have not one idea of the truth of any of my speculations—I shall never be a reasoner, because I care not to be in the right, when retired from bickering and in a proper philosophical temper. So you must not stare if in any future letter, I endeavour to prove that Apollo, as he had catgut strings to his lyre, used a cat’s paw as a pecten—and further from said Pecten’s reiterated and continual teasing came the term hen-pecked. My Brother Tom desires to be remembered to you; he has just this moment had a spitting of blood, poor fellow—Remember me to Gleig and Whitehead.

Your affectionate friend
John Keats.





XLII.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
Teignmouth, Saturday [March 14, 1818].

Dear Reynolds—I escaped being blown over and blown under and trees and house being toppled on me.—I have since hearing of Brown’s accident had an aversion to a dose of parapet, and being also a lover of antiquities[Pg 83] I would sooner have a harmless piece of Herculaneum sent me quietly as a present than ever so modern a chimney-pot tumbled on to my head—Being agog to see some Devonshire, I would have taken a walk the first day, but the rain would not let me; and the second, but the rain would not let me; and the third, but the rain forbade it. Ditto 4—ditto 5—ditto—so I made up my Mind to stop indoors, and catch a sight flying between the showers: and, behold I saw a pretty valley—pretty cliffs, pretty Brooks, pretty Meadows, pretty trees, both standing as they were created, and blown down as they are uncreated—The green is beautiful, as they say, and pity it is that it is amphibious—mais! but alas! the flowers here wait as naturally for the rain twice a day as the Mussels do for the Tide; so we look upon a brook in these parts as you look upon a splash in your Country. There must be something to support this—aye, fog, hail, snow, rain, Mist blanketing up three parts of the year. This Devonshire is like Lydia Languish, very entertaining when it smiles, but cursedly subject to sympathetic moisture. You have the sensation of walking under one great Lamplighter: and you can’t go on the other side of the ladder to keep your frock clean, and cosset your superstition. Buy a girdle—put a pebble in your mouth—loosen your braces—for I am going among scenery whence I intend to tip you the Damosel Radcliffe—I’ll cavern you, and grotto you, and waterfall you, and wood you, and water you, and immense-rock you, and tremendous-sound you, and solitude you. I’ll make a lodgment on your glacis by a row of Pines, and storm your covered way with bramble Bushes. I’ll have at you with hip and haw small-shot, and cannonade you with Shingles—I’ll be witty upon salt-fish, and impede your cavalry with clotted cream. But ah Coward! to talk at this rate to a sick man, or, I hope, to one that was sick—for I hope by this you stand on your right foot. If you are not—that’s all,—I intend to cut all sick people if they do not make up their minds to cut Sickness—a fellow to whom I have a[Pg 84] complete aversion, and who strange to say is harboured and countenanced in several houses where I visit—he is sitting now quite impudent between me and Tom—He insults me at poor Jem Rice’s—and you have seated him before now between us at the Theatre, when I thought he looked with a longing eye at poor Kean. I shall say, once for all, to my friends generally and severally, cut that fellow, or I cut you—

I went to the Theatre here the other night, which I forgot to tell George, and got insulted, which I ought to remember to forget to tell any Body; for I did not fight, and as yet have had no redress—“Lie thou there, sweetheart!”[53] I wrote to Bailey yesterday, obliged to speak in a high way, and a damme who’s afraid—for I had owed him so long; however, he shall see I will be better in future. Is he in town yet? I have directed to Oxford as the better chance. I have copied my fourth Book, and shall write the Preface soon. I wish it was all done; for I want to forget it and make my mind free for something new—Atkins the Coachman, Bartlett the Surgeon, Simmons the Barber, and the Girls over at the Bonnet-shop, say we shall now have a month of seasonable weather—warm, witty, and full of invention—Write to me and tell me that you are well or thereabouts, or by the holy Beaucœur, which I suppose is the Virgin Mary, or the repented Magdalen (beautiful name, that Magdalen), I’ll take to my Wings and fly away to anywhere but old or Nova Scotia—I wish I had a little innocent bit of Metaphysic in my head, to criss-cross the letter: but you know a favourite tune is hardest to be remembered when one wants it most and you, I know, have long ere this taken it for granted that I never have any speculations without associating you in them, where they are of a pleasant nature, and you know enough of me to tell the places where I haunt most, so that if you think for five minutes after having read this, you[Pg 85] will find it a long letter, and see written in the Air above you,

Your most affectionate friend
John Keats.

Remember me to all. Tom’s remembrances to you.





XLIII.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
Teignmouth, Saturday Morn [March 21, 1818].

My dear Haydon—In sooth, I hope you are not too sanguine about that seal—in sooth I hope it is not Brumidgeum—in double sooth I hope it is his—and in triple sooth I hope I shall have an impression.[54] Such a piece of intelligence came doubly welcome to me while in your own County and in your own hand—not but I have blown up the said County for its urinal qualifications—the six first days I was here it did nothing but rain; and at that time having to write to a friend I gave Devonshire a good blowing up—it has been fine for almost three days, and I was coming round a bit; but to-day it rains again—with me the County is yet upon its good behaviour. I have enjoyed the most delightful Walks these three fine days beautiful enough to make me content.

Here all the summer could I stay,
For there’s Bishop’s teign
And King’s teign
And Coomb at the clear teign head—
Where close by the stream
You may have your cream
All spread upon barley bread.

There’s arch Brook
And there’s larch Brook
Both turning many a mill;
And cooling the drouth
Of the salmon’s mouth,
And fattening his silver gill.
[Pg 86]
There is Wild wood,
A Mild hood
To the sheep on the lea o’ the down,
Where the golden furze,
With its green, thin spurs,
Doth catch at the maiden’s gown.

There is Newton marsh
With its spear grass harsh—
A pleasant summer level
Where the maidens sweet
Of the Market Street,
Do meet in the dusk to revel.

There’s the Barton rich
With dyke and ditch
And hedge for the thrush to live in
And the hollow tree
For the buzzing bee
And a bank for the wasp to hive in.

And O, and O
The daisies blow
And the primroses are waken’d,
And the violets white
Sit in silver plight,
And the green bud’s as long as the spike end.

Then who would go
Into dark Soho,
And chatter with dack’d hair’d critics,
When he can stay
For the new-mown hay,
And startle the dappled Prickets?

I know not if this rhyming fit has done anything—it will be safe with you if worthy to put among my Lyrics. Here’s some doggrel for you—Perhaps you would like a bit of b——hrell—

Where be ye going, you Devon Maid?
And what have you there in the Basket?
Ye tight little fairy just fresh from the dairy,
Will ye give me some cream if I ask it?
[Pg 87]
I love your Meads, and I love your flowers,
And I love your junkets mainly,
But ’hind the door I love kissing more,
O look not so disdainly.

I love your hills, and I love your dales,
And I love your flocks a-bleating—
But O, on the heather to lie together,
With both our hearts a-beating!

I’ll put your Basket all safe in a nook,
Your shawl I hang up on the willow,
And we will sigh in the daisy’s eye
And kiss on a grass green pillow.

How does the work go on? I should like to bring out my “Dentatus”[55] at the time your Epic makes its appearance. I expect to have my Mind soon clear for something new. Tom has been much worse: but is now getting better—his remembrances to you. I think of seeing the Dart and Plymouth—but I don’t know. It has as yet been a Mystery to me how and where Wordsworth went. I can’t help thinking he has returned to his Shell—with his beautiful Wife and his enchanting Sister. It is a great Pity that People should by associating themselves with the finest things, spoil them. Hunt has damned Hampstead and masks and sonnets and Italian tales. Wordsworth has damned the lakes—Milman has damned the old drama—West has damned——wholesale. Peacock has damned satire—Ollier has damn’d Music—Hazlitt has damned the bigoted and the blue-stockinged; how durst the Man?! he is your only good damner, and if ever I am damn’d—damn me if I shouldn’t like him to damn me. It will not be long ere I see you, but I thought I would just give you a line out of Devon.

Yours affectionately
John Keats.

Remember me to all we know.





[Pg 88]

XLIV.—TO MESSRS. TAYLOR AND HESSEY.
Teignmouth, Saturday Morn [March 21, 1818].

My dear Sirs—I had no idea of your getting on so fast—I thought of bringing my 4th Book to Town all in good time for you—especially after the late unfortunate chance.

I did not however for my own sake delay finishing the copy which was done a few days after my arrival here. I send it off to-day, and will tell you in a Postscript at what time to send for it from the Bull and Mouth or other Inn. You will find the Preface and dedication and the title Page as I should wish it to stand—for a Romance is a fine thing notwithstanding the circulating Libraries. My respects to Mrs. Hessey and to Percy Street.

Yours very sincerely
John Keats.

P.S.—I have been advised to send it to you—you may expect it on Monday—for I sent it by the Postman to Exeter at the same time with this Letter. Adieu!





XLV.—TO JAMES RICE.
Teignmouth, Tuesday [March 24, 1818].

My dear Rice—Being in the midst of your favourite Devon, I should not, by rights, pen one word but it should contain a vast portion of Wit, Wisdom and learning—for I have heard that Milton ere he wrote his answer to Salmasius came into these parts, and for one whole month, rolled himself for three whole hours (per day?), in a certain meadow hard by us—where the mark of his nose at equidistances is still shown. The exhibitor of the said meadow further saith, that, after these rollings, not a nettle sprang up in all the seven acres for seven years, and that from the said time, a new sort of plant was made from the whitethorn, of a thornless nature, very[Pg 89] much used by the bucks of the present day to rap their boots withal. This account made me very naturally suppose that the nettles and thorns etherealised by the scholar’s rotatory motion, and garnered in his head, thence flew after a process of fermentation against the luckless Salmasius and occasioned his well-known and unhappy end. What a happy thing it would be if we could settle our thoughts and make our minds up on any matter in five minutes, and remain content—that is, build a sort of mental cottage of feelings, quiet and pleasant—to have a sort of Philosophical back-garden, and cheerful holiday-keeping front one—but alas! this never can be: for as the material cottager knows there are such places as France and Italy, and the Andes and burning mountains, so the spiritual Cottager has knowledge of the terra semi-incognita of things unearthly, and cannot for his life keep in the check-rein—or I should stop here quiet and comfortable in my theory of nettles. You will see, however, I am obliged to run wild being attracted by the load-stone concatenation. No sooner had I settled the knotty point of Salmasius, than the Devil put this whim into my head in the likeness of one of Pythagoras’s questionings—Did Milton do more good or harm in the world? He wrote, let me inform you (for I have it from a friend, who had it of ——,) he wrote Lycidas, Comus, Paradise Lost and other Poems, with much delectable prose—He was moreover an active friend to man all his life, and has been since his death.—Very good—but, my dear Fellow, I must let you know that, as there is ever the same quantity of matter constituting this habitable globe—as the ocean notwithstanding the enormous changes and revolutions taking place in some or other of its demesnes—notwithstanding Waterspouts whirlpools and mighty rivers emptying themselves into it—still is made up of the same bulk, nor ever varies the number of its atoms—and as a certain bulk of water was instituted at the creation—so very likely a certain portion of intellect was spun forth into the thin air, for[Pg 90] the brains of man to prey upon it. You will see my drift without any unnecessary parenthesis. That which is contained in the Pacific could not lie in the hollow of the Caspian—that which was in Milton’s head could not find room in Charles the Second’s—He like a Moon attracted intellect to its flow—it has not ebbed yet, but has left the shore-pebbles all bare—I mean all Bucks, Authors of Hengist, and Castlereaghs of the present day; who without Milton’s gormandising might have been all wise men—Now forasmuch as I was very predisposed to a country I had heard you speak so highly of, I took particular notice of everything during my journey, and have bought some folio asses’ skins for memorandums. I have seen everything but the wind—and that, they say, becomes visible by taking a dose of acorns, or sleeping one night in a hog-trough, with your tail to the Sow Sow-West. Some of the little Bar-maids look’d at me as if I knew Jem Rice.... Well, I can’t tell! I hope you are showing poor Reynolds the way to get well. Send me a good account of him, and if I can, I’ll send you one of Tom—Oh! for a day and all well!

I went yesterday to Dawlish fair.

Over the Hill and over the Dale,
And over the Bourne to Dawlish,
Where ginger-bread wives have a scanty sale,
And ginger-bread nuts are smallish, etc. etc.

Tom’s remembrances and mine to you all.

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





XLVI.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
[Teignmouth, March 25, 1818.]

My dear Reynolds—In hopes of cheering you through a Minute or two, I was determined will he nill he to send you some lines, so you will excuse the unconnected subject and careless verse. You know, I am sure,[Pg 91] Claude’s Enchanted Castle,[56] and I wish you may be pleased with my remembrance of it. The Rain is come on again—I think with me Devonshire stands a very poor chance. I shall damn it up hill and down dale, if it keep up to the average of six fine days in three weeks. Let me have better news of you.

Tom’s remembrances to you. Remember us to all.

Your affectionate friend,
John Keats.

Dear Reynolds! as last night I lay in bed,
There came before my eyes that wonted thread
Of shapes, and shadows, and remembrances,
That every other minute vex and please:
Things all disjointed come from north and south,—
Two Witch’s eyes above a Cherub’s mouth,
Voltaire with casque and shield and habergeon,
And Alexander with his nightcap on;
Old Socrates a-tying his cravat,
And Hazlitt playing with Miss Edgeworth’s cat;
And Junius Brutus, pretty well so so,
Making the best of’s way towards Soho.

Few are there who escape these visitings,—
Perhaps one or two whose lives have patent wings,
And thro’ whose curtains peeps no hellish nose,
No wild-boar tushes, and no Mermaid’s toes;
But flowers bursting out with lusty pride,
And young Æolian harps personify’d;
Some Titian colours touch’d into real life,—
The sacrifice goes on; the pontiff knife
Gleams in the Sun, the milk-white heifer lows,
The pipes go shrilly, the libation flows:
[Pg 92]A white sail shows above the green-head cliff,
Moves round the point, and throws her anchor stiff;
The mariners join hymn with those on land.

You know the Enchanted Castle,—it doth stand
Upon a rock, on the border of a Lake,
Nested in trees, which all do seem to shake
From some old magic-like Urganda’s Sword.
O Phœbus! that I had thy sacred word
To show this Castle, in fair dreaming wise,
Unto my friend, while sick and ill he lies!

You know it well enough, where it doth seem
A mossy place, a Merlin’s Hall, a dream;
You know the clear Lake, and the little Isles,
The mountains blue, and cold near neighbour rills,
All which elsewhere are but half animate;
There do they look alive to love and hate,
To smiles and frowns; they seem a lifted mound
Above some giant, pulsing underground.

Part of the Building was a chosen See,
Built by a banish’d Santon of Chaldee;
The other part, two thousand years from him,
Was built by Cuthbert de Saint Aldebrim;
Then there’s a little wing, far from the Sun,
Built by a Lapland Witch turn’d maudlin Nun;
And many other juts of aged stone
Founded with many a mason-devil’s groan.

The doors all look as if they op’d themselves
The windows as if latch’d by Fays and Elves,
And from them comes a silver flash of light,
As from the westward of a Summer’s night;
Or like a beauteous woman’s large blue eyes
Gone mad thro’ olden songs and poesies.

See! what is coming from the distance dim!
A golden Galley all in silken trim!
Three rows of oars are lightening, moment whiles
Into the verd’rous bosoms of those isles;
Towards the shade, under the Castle wall,
It comes in silence,—now ’tis hidden all.
The Clarion sounds, and from a Postern-gate
An echo of sweet music doth create
A fear in the poor Herdsman, who doth bring
His beasts to trouble the enchanted spring,—
He tells of the sweet music, and the spot,
To all his friends, and they believe him not.
[Pg 93]
O that our dreamings all, of sleep or wake,
Would all their colours from the sunset take:
From something of material sublime,
Rather than shadow our own soul’s day-time
In the dark void of night. For in the world
We jostle,—but my flag is not unfurl’d
On the Admiral-staff,—and so philosophise
I dare not yet! Oh, never will the prize,
High reason, and the love of good and ill,
Be my award! Things cannot to the will
Be settled, but they tease us out of thought;
Or is it that imagination brought
Beyond its proper bound, yet still confin’d,
Lost in a sort of Purgatory blind,
Cannot refer to any standard law
Of either earth or heaven? It is a flaw
In happiness, to see beyond our bourn,—
It forces us in summer skies to mourn,
It spoils the singing of the Nightingale.

Dear Reynolds! I have a mysterious tale,
And cannot speak it: the first page I read
Upon a Lampit rock of green sea-weed
Among the breakers; ’twas a quiet eve,
The rocks were silent, the wide sea did weave
An untumultuous fringe of silver foam
Along the flat brown sand; I was at home
And should have been most happy,—but I saw
Too far into the sea, where every maw
The greater on the less feeds evermore.—
But I saw too distinct into the core
Of an eternal fierce destruction,
And so from happiness I far was gone.
Still am I sick of it, and tho’ to-day,
I’ve gather’d young spring-leaves, and flowers gay
Of periwinkle and wild strawberry,
Still do I that most fierce destruction see,—
The Shark at savage prey,—the Hawk at pounce,—
The gentle Robin, like a Pard or Ounce,
Ravening a worm,—Away, ye horrid moods!
Moods of one’s mind! You know I hate them well.
You know I’d sooner be a clapping Bell
To some Kamtschatkan Missionary Church,
Than with these horrid moods be left i’ the lurch.





[Pg 94]

XLVII.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
Wednesday, [Teignmouth, April 8, 1818].

My dear Haydon—I am glad you were pleased with my nonsense, and if it so happen that the humour takes me when I have set down to prose to you I will not gainsay it. I should be (God forgive me) ready to swear because I cannot make use of your assistance in going through Devon if I was not in my own Mind determined to visit it thoroughly at some more favourable time of the year. But now Tom (who is getting greatly better) is anxious to be in Town—therefore I put off my threading the County. I purpose within a month to put my knapsack at my back and make a pedestrian tour through the North of England, and part of Scotland—to make a sort of Prologue to the Life I intend to pursue—that is to write, to study and to see all Europe at the lowest expence. I will clamber through the Clouds and exist. I will get such an accumulation of stupendous recollections that as I walk through the suburbs of London I may not see them—I will stand upon Mount Blanc and remember this coming Summer when I intend to straddle Ben Lomond—with my soul!—galligaskins are out of the Question. I am nearer myself to hear your “Christ” is being tinted into immortality. Believe me Haydon your picture is part of myself—I have ever been too sensible of the labyrinthian path to eminence in Art (judging from Poetry) ever to think I understood the emphasis of painting. The innumerable compositions and decompositions which take place between the intellect and its thousand materials before it arrives at that trembling delicate and snail-horn perception of beauty. I know not your many havens of intenseness—nor ever can know them: but for this I hope not you achieve is lost upon me[57]: for when a Schoolboy the abstract Idea I had[Pg 95] of an heroic painting—was what I cannot describe. I saw it somewhat sideways, large, prominent, round, and colour’d with magnificence—somewhat like the feel I have of Anthony and Cleopatra. Or of Alcibiades leaning on his Crimson Couch in his Galley, his broad shoulders imperceptibly heaving with the Sea. That passage in Shakspeare is finer than this—

See how the surly Warwick mans the Wall.

I like your consignment of Corneille—that’s the humour of it—they shall be called your Posthumous Works.[58] I don’t understand your bit of Italian. I hope she will awake from her dream and flourish fair—my respects to her. The Hedges by this time are beginning to leaf—Cats are becoming more vociferous—young Ladies who wear Watches are always looking at them. Women about forty-five think the Season very backward—Ladies’ Mares have but half an allowance of food. It rains here again, has been doing so for three days—however as I told you I’ll take a trial in June, July, or August next year.

I am afraid Wordsworth went rather huff’d out of Town—I am sorry for it—he cannot expect his fireside Divan to be infallible—he cannot expect but that every man of worth is as proud as himself. O that he had not fit with a Warrener[59]—that is dined at Kingston’s. I shall be in town in about a fortnight and then we will have a day or so now and then before I set out on my northern expedition—we will have no more abominable Rows—for they leave one in a fearful silence—having settled the [Pg 96]Methodists let us be rational—not upon compulsion—no—if it will out let it—but I will not play the Bassoon any more deliberately. Remember me to Hazlitt, and Bewick—

Your affectionate friend,
John Keats.





XLVIII.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
Thy. morng., [Teignmouth, April 9, 1818].

My dear Reynolds—Since you all agree that the thing[60] is bad, it must be so—though I am not aware there is anything like Hunt in it (and if there is, it is my natural way, and I have something in common with Hunt). Look it over again, and examine into the motives, the seeds, from which any one sentence sprung—I have not the slightest feel of humility towards the public—or to anything in existence,—but the eternal Being, the Principle of Beauty, and the Memory of great Men. When I am writing for myself for the mere sake of the moment’s enjoyment, perhaps nature has its course with me—but a Preface is written to the Public; a thing I cannot help looking upon as an Enemy, and which I cannot address without feelings of Hostility. If I write a Preface in a supple or subdued style, it will not be in character with me as a public speaker—I would be subdued before my friends, and thank them for subduing me—but among Multitudes of Men—I have no feel of stooping, I hate the idea of humility to them.

I never wrote one single Line of Poetry with the least Shadow of public thought.

Forgive me for vexing you and making a Trojan horse of such a Trifle, both with respect to the matter in Question, and myself—but it eases me to tell you—I could not live without the love of my friends—I would jump down Ætna for any great Public good—but I hate a Mawkish [Pg 97]Popularity. I cannot be subdued before them—My glory would be to daunt and dazzle the thousand jabberers about Pictures and Books—I see swarms of Porcupines with their Quills erect “like lime-twigs set to catch my Wingëd Book,” and I would fright them away with a torch. You will say my Preface is not much of a Torch. It would have been too insulting “to begin from Jove,” and I could not set a golden head upon a thing of clay. If there is any fault in the Preface it is not affectation, but an undersong of disrespect to the Public—if I write another Preface it must be done without a thought of those people—I will think about it. If it should not reach you in four or five days, tell Taylor to publish it without a Preface, and let the Dedication simply stand—“inscribed to the Memory of Thomas Chatterton.”

I had resolved last night to write to you this morning—I wish it had been about something else—something to greet you towards the close of your long illness. I have had one or two intimations of your going to Hampstead for a space; and I regret to see your confounded Rheumatism keeps you in Little Britain where, I am sure the air is too confined. Devonshire continues rainy. As the drops beat against the window, they give me the same sensation as a quart of cold water offered to revive a half-drowned devil—no feel of the clouds dropping fatness; but as if the roots of the earth were rotten, cold, and drenched. I have not been able to go to Kent’s cave at Babbicombe—however on one very beautiful day I had a fine Clamber over the rocks all along as far as that place. I shall be in Town in about Ten days—We go by way of Bath on purpose to call on Bailey. I hope soon to be writing to you about the things of the north, purposing to wayfare all over those parts. I have settled my accoutrements in my own mind, and will go to gorge wonders. However, we’ll have some days together before I set out—

I have many reasons for going wonder-ways: to make my winter chair free from spleen—to enlarge my vision—to[Pg 98] escape disquisitions on Poetry and Kingston Criticism; to promote digestion and economise shoe-leather. I’ll have leather buttons and belt; and, if Brown holds his mind, over the Hills we go. If my Books will help me to it, then will I take all Europe in turn, and see the Kingdoms of the Earth and the glory of them. Tom is getting better, he hopes you may meet him at the top o’ the hill. My Love to your nurses. I am ever

Your affectionate Friend
John Keats.





XLIX.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
[Teignmouth,] Friday [April 10, 1818].

My dear Reynolds—I am anxious you should find this Preface tolerable. If there is an affectation in it ’tis natural to me. Do let the Printer’s Devil cook it, and let me be as “the casing air.”

You are too good in this Matter—were I in your state, I am certain I should have no thought but of discontent and illness—I might though be taught patience: I had an idea of giving no Preface; however, don’t you think this had better go? O, let it—one should not be too timid—of committing faults.

The climate here weighs us down completely; Tom is quite low-spirited. It is impossible to live in a country which is continually under hatches. Who would live in a region of Mists, Game Laws, indemnity Bills, etc., when there is such a place as Italy? It is said this England from its Clime produces a Spleen, able to engender the finest Sentiments, and cover the whole face of the isle with Green—so it ought, I’m sure.—I should still like the Dedication simply, as I said in my last.

I wanted to send you a few songs written in your favorite Devon—it cannot be—Rain! Rain! Rain! I am going this morning to take a facsimile of a Letter of Nelson’s, very much to his honour—you will be greatly pleased when you see it—in about a week. What a spite[Pg 99] it is one cannot get out—the little way I went yesterday, I found a lane banked on each side with store of Primroses, while the earlier bushes are beginning to leaf.

I shall hear a good account of you soon.

Your affectionate Friend
John Keats.

My Love to all and remember me to Taylor.





L.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
Teignmouth, Friday [April 24, 1818].

My dear Taylor—I think I did wrong to leave to you all the trouble of Endymion—But I could not help it then—another time I shall be more bent to all sorts of troubles and disagreeables. Young men for some time have an idea that such a thing as happiness is to be had, and therefore are extremely impatient under any unpleasant restraining. In time however, of such stuff is the world about them, they know better, and instead of striving from uneasiness, greet it as an habitual sensation, a pannier which is to weigh upon them through life—And in proportion to my disgust at the task is my sense of your kindness and anxiety. The book pleased me much. It is very free from faults: and, although there are one or two words I should wish replaced, I see in many places an improvement greatly to the purpose.

I think those speeches which are related—those parts where the speaker repeats a speech, such as Glaucus’s repetition of Circe’s words, should have inverted commas to every line. In this there is a little confusion.—If we divide the speeches into identical and related; and to the former put merely one inverted Comma at the beginning and another at the end; and to the latter inverted Commas before every line, the book will be better understood at the 1st glance. Look at pages 126, 127, you will find in the 3d line the beginning of a related speech marked thus “Ah! art awake—” while, at the same time, in the next page the continuation of the identical speech is[Pg 100] marked in the same manner, “Young man of Latmos—” You will find on the other side all the parts which should have inverted commas to every line.

I was proposing to travel over the North this summer. There is but one thing to prevent me.—I know nothing—I have read nothing—and I mean to follow Solomon’s directions, “Get learning—get understanding.” I find earlier days are gone by—I find that I can have no enjoyment in the world but continual drinking of knowledge. I find there is no worthy pursuit but the idea of doing some good for the world—Some do it with their Society—some with their wit—some with their benevolence—some with a sort of power of conferring pleasure and good-humour on all they meet—and in a thousand ways, all dutiful to the command of great Nature—there is but one way for me. The road lies through application, study, and thought.—I will pursue it; and for that end, purpose retiring for some years. I have been hovering for some time between an exquisite sense of the luxurious, and a love for philosophy,—were I calculated for the former, I should be glad. But as I am not, I shall turn all my soul to the latter.—My brother Tom is getting better, and I hope I shall see both him and Reynolds better before I retire from the world. I shall see you soon, and have some talk about what Books I shall take with me.

Your very sincere friend
John Keats.

Pray remember me to Hessey Woodhouse and Percy Street.





LI.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
Teignmouth, April 27, 1818.

My dear Reynolds—It is an awful while since you have heard from me—I hope I may not be punished, when I see you well, and so anxious as you always are for me, with the remembrance of my so seldom writing when you were so horribly confined. The most unhappy[Pg 101] hours in our lives are those in which we recollect times past to our own blushing—If we are immortal that must be the Hell. If I must be immortal, I hope it will be after having taken a little of “that watery labyrinth” in order to forget some of my school-boy days and others since those.

I have heard from George at different times how slowly you were recovering—It is a tedious thing—but all Medical Men will tell you how far a very gradual amendment is preferable; you will be strong after this, never fear. We are here still enveloped in clouds—I lay awake last night listening to the Rain with a sense of being drowned and rotted like a grain of wheat. There is a continual courtesy between the Heavens and the Earth. The heavens rain down their unwelcomeness, and the Earth sends it up again to be returned to-morrow. Tom has taken a fancy to a physician here, Dr. Turton, and I think is getting better—therefore I shall perhaps remain here some Months. I have written to George for some Books—shall learn Greek, and very likely Italian—and in other ways prepare myself to ask Hazlitt in about a year’s time the best metaphysical road I can take. For although I take poetry to be Chief, yet there is something else wanting to one who passes his life among Books and thoughts on Books—I long to feast upon old Homer as we have upon Shakspeare, and as I have lately upon Milton. If you understood Greek, and would read me passages, now and then, explaining their meaning, ’twould be, from its mistiness, perhaps, a greater luxury than reading the thing one’s self. I shall be happy when I can do the same for you. I have written for my folio Shakspeare, in which there are the first few stanzas of my “Pot of Basil.” I have the rest here finished, and will copy the whole out fair shortly, and George will bring it you—The compliment is paid by us to Boccace, whether we publish or no: so there is content in this world—mine is short—you must be deliberate about yours: you must not think of it till many months after you are[Pg 102] quite well:—then put your passion to it, and I shall be bound up with you in the shadows of Mind, as we are in our matters of human life. Perhaps a Stanza or two will not be too foreign to your Sickness.

Were they unhappy then?—It cannot be—
Too many tears for lovers have been shed,
Too many sighs give we to them in fee,
Too much of pity after they are dead,
Too many doleful stories do we see,
Whose matter in bright gold were best be read;
Except in such a page where Theseus’ spouse
Over the pathless waves towards him bows.

But, for the general award of love
The little sweet doth kill much bitterness;
Though Dido silent is in under-grove,
And Isabella’s was a great distress,
Though young Lorenzo in warm Indian clove
Was not embalm’d, this truth is not the less—
Even bees, the little almsmen of spring-bowers,
Know there is richest juice in poison-flowers.
   ——————
She wept alone for pleasures not to be;
Sorely she wept until the night came on,
And then, instead of love, O misery!
She brooded o’er the luxury alone:
What might have been too plainly did she see,[61]
And to the silence made a gentle moan,
Spreading her perfect arms upon the air,
And on her couch low murmuring “Where? O where?”

I heard from Rice this morning—very witty—and have just written to Bailey. Don’t you think I am brushing up in the letter way? and being in for it, you shall hear again from me very shortly:—if you will promise not to put hand to paper for me until you can do it with a tolerable ease of health—except it be a line or two. Give my Love to your Mother and Sisters. Remember me to the Butlers—not forgetting Sarah.

Your affectionate Friend
John Keats.





[Pg 103]

LII.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
Teignmouth, May 3d [1818].

My dear Reynolds—What I complain of is that I have been in so uneasy a state of Mind as not to be fit to write to an invalid. I cannot write to any length under a disguised feeling. I should have loaded you with an addition of gloom, which I am sure you do not want. I am now thank God in a humour to give you a good groat’s worth—for Tom, after a Night without a Wink of sleep, and over-burthened with fever, has got up after a refreshing day-sleep and is better than he has been for a long time; and you I trust have been again round the common without any effect but refreshment. As to the Matter I hope I can say with Sir Andrew[62] “I have matter enough in my head” in your favour—And now, in the second place, for I reckon that I have finished my Imprimis, I am glad you blow up the weather—all through your letter there is a leaning towards a climate-curse, and you know what a delicate satisfaction there is in having a vexation anathematised: one would think there has been growing up for these last four thousand years, a grand-child Scion of the old forbidden tree, and that some modern Eve had just violated it; and that there was come with double charge

“Notus and Afer, black with thundrous clouds
From Serraliona—”

I shall breathe worsted stockings[63] sooner than I thought for—Tom wants to be in Town—we will have some such days upon the heath like that of last summer—and why not with the same book? or what say you to a black Letter Chaucer, printed in 1596: aye I’ve got one huzza! I shall have it bound en gothique—a nice sombre binding—it will go a little way to unmodernise. And also I see no reason, because I have been away this last month, why I should not have a peep at your[Pg 104] Spenserian—notwithstanding you speak of your office, in my thought a little too early, for I do not see why a Mind like yours is not capable of harbouring and digesting the whole Mystery of Law as easily as Parson Hugh does pippins, which did not hinder him from his poetic canary.[64] Were I to study physic or rather Medicine again, I feel it would not make the least difference in my Poetry; when the mind is in its infancy a Bias is in reality a Bias, but when we have acquired more strength, a Bias becomes no Bias. Every department of Knowledge we see excellent and calculated towards a great whole—I am so convinced of this that I am glad at not having given away my medical Books, which I shall again look over to keep alive the little I know thitherwards; and moreover intend through you and Rice to become a sort of pip-civilian. An extensive knowledge is needful to thinking people—it takes away the heat and fever; and helps, by widening speculation, to ease the Burden of the Mystery, a thing which I begin to understand a little, and which weighed upon you in the most gloomy and true sentence in your Letter. The difference of high Sensations with and without knowledge appears to me this: in the latter case we are falling continually ten thousand fathoms deep and being blown up again, without wings, and with all horror of a bare-shouldered Creature—in the former case, our shoulders are fledged, and we go through the same air and space without fear. This is running one’s rigs on the score of abstracted benefit—when we come to human Life and the affections, it is impossible to know how a parallel of breast and head can be drawn (you will forgive me for thus privately treading out of my depth, and take it for treading as school-boys tread the water); it is impossible to know how far knowledge will console us for the death of a friend, and the ill “that flesh is heir to.” With respect to the affections and Poetry you must know by a [Pg 105]sympathy my thoughts that way, and I daresay these few lines will be but a ratification: I wrote them on Mayday—and intend to finish the ode all in good time—

Mother of Hermes! and still youthful Maia!
May I sing to thee
As thou wast hymned on the shores of Baiæ?
Or may I woo thee
In earlier Sicilian? or thy smiles
Seek as they once were sought, in Grecian isles,
By Bards who died content on pleasant sward,
Leaving great verse unto a little clan?
O, give me their old vigour, and unheard
Save of the quiet Primrose, and the span
Of heaven and few ears,
Rounded by thee, my song should die away
Content as theirs,
Rich in the simple worship of a day.—

You may perhaps be anxious to know for fact to what sentence in your Letter I allude. You say, “I fear there is little chance of anything else in this life”—you seem by that to have been going through with a more painful and acute zest the same labyrinth that I have—I have come to the same conclusion thus far. My Branchings out therefrom have been numerous: one of them is the consideration of Wordsworth’s genius and as a help, in the manner of gold being the meridian Line of worldly wealth, how he differs from Milton. And here I have nothing but surmises, from an uncertainty whether Milton’s apparently less anxiety for Humanity proceeds from his seeing further or not than Wordsworth: And whether Wordsworth has in truth epic passion, and martyrs himself to the human heart, the main region of his song. In regard to his genius alone—we find what he says true as far as we have experienced, and we can judge no further but by larger experience—for axioms in philosophy are not axioms until they are proved upon our pulses. We read fine things, but never feel them to the full until we have gone the same steps as the author.—I know this is not plain; you will know exactly my meaning[Pg 106] when I say that now I shall relish Hamlet more than I ever have done—Or, better—you are sensible no man can set down Venery as a bestial or joyless thing until he is sick of it, and therefore all philosophising on it would be mere wording. Until we are sick, we understand not; in fine, as Byron says, “Knowledge is sorrow”; and I go on to say that “Sorrow is wisdom”—and further for aught we can know for certainty “Wisdom is folly”—So you see how I have run away from Wordsworth and Milton, and shall still run away from what was in my head, to observe, that some kind of letters are good squares, others handsome ovals, and other some orbicular, others spheroid—and why should not there be another species with two rough edges like a Rat-trap? I hope you will find all my long letters of that species, and all will be well; for by merely touching the spring delicately and ethereally, the rough-edged will fly immediately into a proper compactness; and thus you may make a good wholesome loaf, with your own leaven in it, of my fragments—If you cannot find this said Rat-trap sufficiently tractable, alas for me, it being an impossibility in grain for my ink to stain otherwise: If I scribble long letters I must play my vagaries—I must be too heavy, or too light, for whole pages—I must be quaint and free of Tropes and figures—I must play my draughts as I please, and for my advantage and your erudition, crown a white with a black, or a black with a white, and move into black or white, far and near as I please—I must go from Hazlitt to Patmore, and make Wordsworth and Coleman play at leap-frog, or keep one of them down a whole half-holiday at fly-the-garter—“From Gray to Gay, from Little to Shakspeare.” Also as a long cause requires two or more sittings of the Court, so a long letter will require two or more sittings of the Breech, wherefore I shall resume after dinner—

Have you not seen a Gull, an orc, a Sea-Mew, or anything to bring this Line to a proper length, and also fill[Pg 107] up this clear part; that like the Gull I may dip[65]—I hope, not out of sight—and also, like a Gull, I hope to be lucky in a good-sized fish—This crossing a letter is not without its association—for chequer-work leads us naturally to a Milkmaid, a Milkmaid to Hogarth, Hogarth to Shakspeare—Shakspeare to Hazlitt—Hazlitt to Shakspeare—and thus by merely pulling an apron-string we set a pretty peal of Chimes at work—Let them chime on while, with your patience, I will return to Wordsworth—whether or no he has an extended vision or a circumscribed grandeur—whether he is an eagle in his nest or on the wing—And to be more explicit and to show you how tall I stand by the giant, I will put down a simile of human life as far as I now perceive it; that is, to the point to which I say we both have arrived at—Well—I compare human life to a large Mansion of Many apartments, two of which I can only describe, the doors of the rest being as yet shut upon me—The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain there a long while, and notwithstanding the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one’s vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing one’s nerves that the world is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby this Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darkened, and at the same time, on all sides of it, many doors are[Pg 108] set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil—we are in a mist—we are now in that state—We feel the “burden of the Mystery.” To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive, when he wrote ‘Tintern Abbey,’ and it seems to me that his Genius is explorative of those dark Passages. Now if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them—He is a genius and superior to us, in so far as he can, more than we, make discoveries and shed a light in them—Here I must think Wordsworth is deeper than Milton, though I think it has depended more upon the general and gregarious advance of intellect, than individual greatness of Mind—From the Paradise Lost and the other Works of Milton, I hope it is not too presuming, even between ourselves, to say, that his Philosophy, human and divine, may be tolerably understood by one not much advanced in years. In his time, Englishmen were just emancipated from a great superstition, and Men had got hold of certain points and resting-places in reasoning which were too newly born to be doubted, and too much opposed by the Mass of Europe not to be thought ethereal and authentically divine—Who could gainsay his ideas on virtue, vice, and Chastity in Comus, just at the time of the dismissal of a hundred disgraces? who would not rest satisfied with his hintings at good and evil in the Paradise Lost, when just free from the Inquisition and burning in Smithfield? The Reformation produced such immediate and great benefits, that Protestantism was considered under the immediate eye of heaven, and its own remaining Dogmas and superstitions then, as it were, regenerated, constituted those resting-places and seeming sure points of Reasoning—from that I have mentioned, Milton, whatever he may have thought in the sequel, appears to have been content with these by his writings—He did not think into the human heart as Wordsworth has done—Yet Milton as a Philosopher had sure as great powers as Wordsworth—What is[Pg 109] then to be inferred? O many things—It proves there is really a grand march of intellect,—It proves that a mighty providence subdues the mightiest Minds to the service of the time being, whether it be in human Knowledge or Religion. I have often pitied a tutor who has to hear “Nom. Musa” so often dinn’d into his ears—I hope you may not have the same pain in this scribbling—I may have read these things before, but I never had even a thus dim perception of them; and moreover I like to say my lesson to one who will endure my tediousness for my own sake—After all there is certainly something real in the world—Moore’s present to Hazlitt is real—I like that Moore, and am glad I saw him at the Theatre just before I left Town. Tom has spit a leetle blood this afternoon, and that is rather a damper—but I know—the truth is there is something real in the World. Your third Chamber of Life shall be a lucky and a gentle one—stored with the wine of love—and the Bread of Friendship—When you see George if he should not have received a letter from me tell him he will find one at home most likely—tell Bailey I hope soon to see him—Remember me to all. The leaves have been out here for mony a day—I have written to George for the first stanzas of my Isabel—I shall have them soon, and will copy the whole out for you.

Your affectionate Friend
John Keats.





LIII.—TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.
Hampstead, Thursday [May 28, 1818].

My dear Bailey—I should have answered your Letter on the Moment, if I could have said yes to your invitation. What hinders me is insuperable: I will tell it at a little length. You know my Brother George has been out of employ for some time: it has weighed very much upon him, and driven him to scheme and turn over things in his Mind. The result has been his resolution to emigrate to the back Settlements of America, become[Pg 110] Farmer and work with his own hands, after purchasing 14 hundred acres of the American Government. This for many reasons has met with my entire Consent—and the chief one is this; he is of too independent and liberal a Mind to get on in Trade in this Country, in which a generous Man with a scanty resource must be ruined. I would sooner he should till the ground than bow to a customer. There is no choice with him: he could not bring himself to the latter. I would not consent to his going alone;—no—but that objection is done away with: he will marry before he sets sail a young lady he has known for several years, of a nature liberal and high-spirited enough to follow him to the Banks of the Mississippi. He will set off in a month or six weeks, and you will see how I should wish to pass that time with him.—And then I must set out on a journey of my own. Brown and I are going a pedestrian tour through the north of England and Scotland as far as John o’ Grot’s. I have this morning such a lethargy that I cannot write. The reason of my delaying is oftentimes from this feeling,—I wait for a proper temper. Now you ask for an immediate answer, I do not like to wait even till to-morrow. However, I am now so depressed that I have not an idea to put to paper—my hand feels like lead—and yet it is an unpleasant numbness; it does not take away the pain of Existence. I don’t know what to write.


Monday [June 1].

You see how I have delayed; and even now I have but a confused idea of what I should be about. My intellect must be in a degenerating state—it must be—for when I should be writing about—God knows what—I am troubling you with moods of my own mind, or rather body, for mind there is none. I am in that temper that if I were under water I would scarcely kick to come up to the top—I know very well ’tis all nonsense—In a short time I hope I shall be in a temper to feel sensibly your mention of my book. In vain have[Pg 111] I waited till Monday to have any Interest in that or anything else. I feel no spur at my Brother’s going to America, and am almost stony-hearted about his wedding. All this will blow over—All I am sorry for is having to write to you in such a time—but I cannot force my letters in a hotbed. I could not feel comfortable in making sentences for you. I am your debtor—I must ever remain so—nor do I wish to be clear of any Rational debt: there is a comfort in throwing oneself on the charity of one’s friends—’tis like the albatross sleeping on its wings. I will be to you wine in the cellar, and the more modestly, or rather, indolently, I retire into the backward bin, the more Falerne will I be at the drinking. There is one thing I must mention—my Brother talks of sailing in a fortnight—if so I will most probably be with you a week before I set out for Scotland. The middle of your first page should be sufficient to rouse me. What I said is true, and I have dreamt of your mention of it, and my not answering it has weighed on me since. If I come, I will bring your letter, and hear more fully your sentiments on one or two points. I will call about the Lectures at Taylor’s, and at Little Britain, to-morrow. Yesterday I dined with Hazlitt, Barnes, and Wilkie, at Haydon’s. The topic was the Duke of Wellington—very amusingly pro-and-con’d. Reynolds has been getting much better; and Rice may begin to crow, for he got a little so-so at a party of his, and was none the worse for it the next morning. I hope I shall soon see you, for we must have many new thoughts and feelings to analyse, and to discover whether a little more knowledge has not made us more ignorant.

Yours affectionately
John Keats.





LIV.—TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.
London [June 10, 1818].

My dear Bailey—I have been very much gratified and very much hurt by your letters in the Oxford[Pg 112] Paper:[66] because independent of that unlawful and mortal feeling of pleasure at praise, there is a glory in enthusiasm; and because the world is malignant enough to chuckle at the most honourable Simplicity. Yes, on my soul, my dear Bailey, you are too simple for the world—and that Idea makes me sick of it. How is it that by extreme opposites we have, as it were, got discontented nerves? You have all your life (I think so) believed everybody. I have suspected everybody. And, although you have been so deceived, you make a simple appeal—the world has something else to do, and I am glad of it—Were it in my choice, I would reject a Petrarchal coronation—on account of my dying day, and because women have cancers. I should not by rights speak in this tone to you for it is an incendiary spirit that would do so. Yet I am not old enough or magnanimous enough to annihilate self—and it would perhaps be paying you an ill compliment. I was in hopes some little time back to be able to relieve your dulness by my spirits—to point out things in the world worth your enjoyment—and now I am never alone without rejoicing that there is such a thing as death—without placing my ultimate in the glory of dying for a great human purpose. Perhaps if my affairs were in a different state, I should not have written the above—you shall judge: I have two brothers; one is driven, by the “burden of Society,” to America; the other with an exquisite love of life, is in a lingering state—My love for my Brothers, from the early loss of our Parents, and even from earlier misfortunes,[67] has grown into an affection “passing the love of women.” I have been ill-tempered with them—I have vexed them—but the thought of them has always stifled the impression that any woman might otherwise have made upon me. I have a sister too, and may not follow them either to America or to the grave. Life must be undergone, and I certainly derive some[Pg 113] consolation from the thought of writing one or two more poems before it ceases.

I have heard some hints of your retiring to Scotland—I should like to know your feeling on it—it seems rather remote. Perhaps Gleig will have a duty near you. I am not certain whether I shall be able to go any journey, on account of my Brother Tom, and a little indisposition of my own. If I do not you shall see me soon, if no on my return or I’ll quarter myself on you next winter. I had known my sister-in-law some time before she was my sister, and was very fond of her. I like her better and better. She is the most disinterested woman I ever knew—that is to say, she goes beyond degree in it. To see an entirely disinterested girl quite happy is the most pleasant and extraordinary thing in the world—It depends upon a thousand circumstances—On my word it is extraordinary. Women must want Imagination, and they may thank God for it; and so may we, that a delicate being can feel happy without any sense of crime. It puzzles me, and I have no sort of logic to comfort me—I shall think it over. I am not at home, and your letter being there I cannot look it over to answer any particular—only I must say I feel that passage of Dante. If I take any book with me it shall be those minute volumes of Carey, for they will go into the aptest corner.

Reynolds is getting, I may say, robust, his illness has been of service to him—like every one just recovered, he is high-spirited—I hear also good accounts of Rice. With respect to domestic literature, the Edinburgh Magazine, in another blow-up against Hunt, calls me “the amiable Mister Keats”—and I have more than a laurel from the Quarterly Reviewers for they have smothered me in “Foliage.” I want to read you my “Pot of Basil”—if you go to Scotland, I should much like to read it there to you, among the snows of next winter. My Brothers’ remembrances to you.

Your affectionate friend
John Keats.





[Pg 114]

LV.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
[Hampstead,] Sunday Evening [June 21, 1818].

My dear Taylor—I am sorry I have not had time to call and wish you health till my return—Really I have been hard run these last three days—However, au revoir, God keep us all well! I start to-morrow Morning. My brother Tom will I am afraid be lonely. I can scarce ask a loan of books for him, since I still keep those you lent me a year ago. If I am overweening, you will I know be indulgent. Therefore when you shall write, do send him some you think will be most amusing—he will be careful in returning them. Let him have one of my books bound. I am ashamed to catalogue these messages. There is but one more, which ought to go for nothing as there is a lady concerned. I promised Mrs. Reynolds one of my books bound. As I cannot write in it let the opposite[68] be pasted in ’prythee. Remember me to Percy St.—Tell Hilton that one gratification on my return will be to find him engaged on a history piece to his own content—And tell Dewint I shall become a disputant on the landscape—Bow for me very genteelly to Mrs. D. or she will not admit your diploma. Remember me to Hessey, saying I hope he’ll Cary his point. I would not forget Woodhouse. Adieu!

Your sincere friend
John o’ Grots.





LVI.—TO THOMAS KEATS.
Keswick, June 29th [1818].

My dear Tom—I cannot make my Journal as distinct and actual as I could wish, from having been engaged in writing to George, and therefore I must tell you without circumstance that we proceeded from Ambleside to Rydal, saw the Waterfalls there, and called on [Pg 115]Wordsworth, who was not at home, nor was any one of his family. I wrote a note and left it on the mantel-piece. Thence on we came to the foot of Helvellyn, where we slept, but could not ascend it for the mist. I must mention that from Rydal we passed Thirlswater, and a fine pass in the Mountains—from Helvellyn we came to Keswick on Derwent Water. The approach to Derwent Water surpassed Windermere—it is richly wooded, and shut in with rich-toned Mountains. From Helvellyn to Keswick was eight miles to Breakfast, after which we took a complete circuit of the Lake, going about ten miles, and seeing on our way the Fall of Lowdore. I had an easy climb among the streams, about the fragments of Rocks and should have got I think to the summit, but unfortunately I was damped by slipping one leg into a squashy hole. There is no great body of water, but the accompaniment is delightful; for it oozes out from a cleft in perpendicular Rocks, all fledged with Ash and other beautiful trees.[69] It is a strange thing how they got there. At the south end of the Lake, the Mountains of Borrowdale are perhaps as fine as anything we have seen. On our return from this circuit, we ordered dinner, and set forth about a mile and a half on the Penrith road, to see the Druid temple. We had a fag up hill, rather too near dinner-time, which was rendered void by the gratification of seeing those aged stones on a gentle rise in the midst of the Mountains, which at that time darkened all around, except at the fresh opening of the Vale of St. John. We went to bed rather fatigued, but not so much so as to hinder us getting up this morning to mount Skiddaw. It promised all along to be fair, and we had fagged and tugged nearly to the top, when, at half-past six, there came a Mist upon us and shut out the view. We did not, however, lose anything by it: we were high enough without mist to see the coast of Scotland—the[Pg 116] Irish Sea—the hills beyond Lancaster—and nearly all the large ones of Cumberland and Westmoreland, particularly Helvellyn and Scawfell. It grew colder and colder as we ascended, and we were glad, at about three parts of the way, to taste a little rum which the Guide brought with him, mixed, mind ye, with Mountain water. I took two glasses going and one returning. It is about six miles from where I am writing to the top—So we have walked ten miles before Breakfast to-day. We went up with two others, very good sort of fellows—All felt, on arising into the cold air, that same elevation which a cold bath gives one—I felt as if I were going to a Tournament.

Wordsworth’s house is situated just on the rise of the foot of Mount Rydal; his parlour-window looks directly down Windermere; I do not think I told you how fine the Vale of Grasmere is, and how I discovered “the ancient woman seated on Helm Crag”[70]—We shall proceed immediately to Carlisle, intending to enter Scotland on the 1st of July viâ—


[Carlisle,] July 1st.

We are this morning at Carlisle. After Skiddaw, we walked to Treby the oldest market town in Cumberland—where we were greatly amused by a country dancing-school holden at the Tun, it was indeed “no new cotillon fresh from France.” No, they kickit and jumpit with mettle extraordinary, and whiskit, and friskit, and toed it, and go’d it, and twirl’d it, and whirl’d it, and stamped it, and sweated it, tattooing the floor like mad. The difference between our country dances and these Scottish figures is about the same as leisurely stirring a cup o’ Tea and beating up a batter-pudding. I was extremely gratified to think that, if I had pleasures they knew nothing of, they had also some into which I could not possibly enter. I hope I shall not return without having got the Highland fling.[Pg 117] There was as fine a row of boys and girls as you ever saw; some beautiful faces, and one exquisite mouth. I never felt so near the glory of Patriotism, the glory of making by any means a country happier. This is what I like better than scenery. I fear our continued moving from place to place will prevent our becoming learned in village affairs: we are mere creatures of Rivers, Lakes, and Mountains. Our yesterday’s journey was from Treby to Wigton, and from Wigton to Carlisle. The Cathedral does not appear very fine—the Castle is very ancient, and of brick. The City is very various—old white-washed narrow streets—broad red-brick ones more modern—I will tell you anon whether the inside of the Cathedral is worth looking at. It is built of sandy red stone or Brick. We have now walked 114 miles, and are merely a little tired in the thighs, and a little blistered. We shall ride 38 miles to Dumfries, when we shall linger awhile about Nithsdale and Galloway. I have written two letters to Liverpool. I found a letter from sister George; very delightful indeed: I shall preserve it in the bottom of my knapsack for you.


[Dumfries, evening of same day, July 1.]

ON VISITING THE TOMB OF BURNS.

The Town, the churchyard, and the setting sun,
The Clouds, the trees, the rounded hills all seem,
Though beautiful, Cold—strange—as in a dream,
I dreamed long ago, now new begun.
The short-liv’d, paly Summer is but won
From Winter’s ague, for one hour’s gleam;
Though sapphire-warm, their stars do never beam:
All is cold Beauty; pain is never done:
For who has mind to relish, Minos-wise,
The Real of Beauty, free from that dead hue
Sickly imagination and sick pride
Cast wan upon it! Burns! with honour due
I oft have honour’d thee. Great shadow, hide
Thy face; I sin against thy native skies.

You will see by this sonnet that I am at Dumfries. We have dined in Scotland. Burns’s tomb is in the[Pg 118] Churchyard corner, not very much to my taste, though on a scale large enough to show they wanted to honour him. Mrs. Burns lives in this place; most likely we shall see her to-morrow—This Sonnet I have written in a strange mood, half-asleep. I know not how it is, the Clouds, the Sky, the Houses, all seem anti-Grecian and anti-Charlemagnish. I will endeavour to get rid of my prejudices and tell you fairly about the Scotch.


[Dumfries,] July 2nd.

In Devonshire they say, “Well, where be ye going?” Here it is, “How is it wi’ yoursel?” A man on the Coach said the horses took a Hellish heap o’ drivin’; the same fellow pointed out Burns’s Tomb with a deal of life—“There de ye see it, amang the trees—white, wi’ a roond tap?” The first well-dressed Scotchman we had any conversation with, to our surprise confessed himself a Deist. The careful manner of delivering his opinions, not before he had received several encouraging hints from us, was very amusing. Yesterday was an immense Horse-fair at Dumfries, so that we met numbers of men and women on the road, the women nearly all barefoot, with their shoes and clean stockings in hand, ready to put on and look smart in the Towns. There are plenty of wretched cottages whose smoke has no outlet but by the door. We have now begun upon Whisky, called here Whuskey,—very smart stuff it is. Mixed like our liquors, with sugar and water,’tis called toddy; very pretty drink, and much praised by Burns.





LVII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Dumfries, July 2nd [1818].

My dear Fanny—I intended to have written to you from Kirkcudbright, the town I shall be in to-morrow—but I will write now because my Knapsack has worn my coat in the Seams, my coat has gone to the Tailor’s and I have but one Coat to my back in these parts.[Pg 119] I must tell you how I went to Liverpool with George and our new Sister and the Gentleman my fellow traveller through the Summer and autumn—We had a tolerable journey to Liverpool—which I left the next morning before George was up for Lancaster—Then we set off from Lancaster on foot with our Knapsacks on, and have walked a Little zig-zag through the mountains and Lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland—We came from Carlisle yesterday to this place—We are employed in going up Mountains, looking at strange towns, prying into old ruins and eating very hearty breakfasts. Here we are full in the Midst of broad Scotch “How is it a’ wi’ yoursel”—the Girls are walking about bare-footed and in the worst cottages the smoke finds its way out of the door. I shall come home full of news for you and for fear I should choak you by too great a dose at once I must make you used to it by a letter or two. We have been taken for travelling Jewellers, Razor sellers and Spectacle vendors because friend Brown wears a pair. The first place we stopped at with our Knapsacks contained one Richard Bradshaw, a notorious tippler. He stood in the shape of a ℥ and ballanced himself as well as he could saying with his nose right in Mr. Brown’s face “Do—yo—u sell spect—ta—cles?” Mr. Abbey says we are Don Quixotes—tell him we are more generally taken for Pedlars. All I hope is that we may not be taken for excisemen in this whisky country. We are generally up about 5 walking before breakfast and we complete our 20 miles before dinner.—Yesterday we visited Burns’s Tomb and this morning the fine Ruins of Lincluden.


[Auchencairn, same day, July 2.]

I had done thus far when my coat came back fortified at all points—so as we lose no time we set forth again through Galloway—all very pleasant and pretty with no fatigue when one is used to it—We are in the midst of Meg Merrilies’s country of whom I suppose you have heard.

[Pg 120] Old Meg she was a Gipsy,
And liv’d upon the Moors:
Her bed it was the brown heath turf,
And her house was out of doors.

Her apples were swart blackberries,
Her currants pods o’ broom;
Her wine was dew of the wild white rose,
Her book a churchyard tomb.

Her Brothers were the craggy hills,
Her Sisters larchen trees—
Alone with her great family
She liv’d as she did please.

No breakfast had she many a morn,
No dinner many a noon,
And ’stead of supper she would stare
Full hard against the Moon.

But every morn of woodbine fresh
She made her garlanding,
And every night the dark glen Yew
She wove, and she would sing.

And with her fingers old and brown
She plaited Mats o’ Rushes,
And gave them to the Cottagers
She met among the Bushes.

Old Meg was brave as Margaret Queen
And tall as Amazon:
An old red blanket cloak she wore;
A chip hat had she on.
God rest her aged bones somewhere—
She died full long agone!

If you like these sort of Ballads I will now and then scribble one for you—if I send any to Tom I’ll tell him to send them to you.


[Kirkcudbright, evening of same day, July 2.]

I have so many interruptions that I cannot manage to fill a Letter in one day—since I scribbled the song we have walked through a beautiful Country to Kirkcudbright—at which place I will write you a song about myself—

[Pg 121] There was a naughty Boy,
A naughty boy was he,
He would not stop at home,
He could not quiet be—
He took
In his Knapsack
A Book
Full of vowels
And a shirt
With some towels—
A slight cap
For night cap—
A hair brush,
Comb ditto,
New Stockings
For old ones
Would split O!
This Knapsack
Tight at’s back
He rivetted close
And followéd his Nose
To the North,
To the North,
And follow’d his nose
To the North.

There was a naughty boy
And a naughty boy was he,
For nothing would he do
But scribble poetry—
He took
An inkstand
In his hand
And a Pen
Big as ten
In the other,
And away
In a Pother
He ran
To the mountains
And fountains
And ghostes
And Postes
And witches
And ditches
And wrote
In his coat
When the weather
Was cool,
Fear of gout,
And without
When the weather
Was warm—
Och the charm
When we choose
To follow one’s nose
To the north,
To the north,
To follow one’s nose
To the north!

There was a naughty boy
And a naughty boy was he,
He kept little fishes
In washing tubs three
In spite
Of the might
Of the Maid
Nor afraid
Of his Granny-good—
He often would
Hurly burly
Get up early
And go
By hook or crook
To the brook
And bring home
Miller’s thumb,
Tittlebat
Not over fat,
Minnows small
As the stall
Of a glove,
Not above
The size
Of a nice
Little Baby’s
Little fingers—
O he made
’Twas his trade
Of Fish a pretty Kettle
A Kettle—
A Kettle
Of Fish a pretty Kettle
A Kettle!
[Pg 122]
There was a naughty Boy,
And a naughty Boy was he,
He ran away to Scotland
The people for to see—
Then he found
That the ground
Was as hard,
That a yard
Was as long,
That a song
Was as merry,
That a cherry
Was as red—
That lead
Was as weighty,
That fourscore
Was as eighty,
That a door
Was as wooden
As in England—
So he stood in his shoes
And he wonder’d
He wonder’d,
He stood in his shoes
And he wonder’d.


[Newton Stewart, July 4.]

My dear Fanny, I am ashamed of writing you such stuff, nor would I if it were not for being tired after my day’s walking, and ready to tumble into bed so fatigued that when I am asleep you might sew my nose to my great toe and trundle me round the town, like a Hoop, without waking me. Then I get so hungry a Ham goes but a very little way and fowls are like Larks to me—A Batch of Bread I make no more ado with than a sheet of parliament; and I can eat a Bull’s head as easily as I used to do Bull’s eyes. I take a whole string of Pork Sausages down as easily as a Pen’orth of Lady’s fingers. Ah dear I must soon be contented with an acre or two of oaten cake a hogshead of Milk and a Clothes-basket of Eggs morning noon and night when I get among the Highlanders. Before we see them we shall pass into Ireland and have a chat with the Paddies, and look at the Giant’s Causeway which you must have heard of—I have not time to tell you particularly for I have to send a Journal to Tom of whom you shall hear all particulars or from me when I return. Since I began this we have walked sixty miles to Newton Stewart at which place I put in this Letter—to-night we sleep at Glenluce—to-morrow at Portpatrick and the next day we shall cross in the passage boat to Ireland. I hope Miss Abbey has[Pg 123] quite recovered. Present my Respects to her and to Mr. and Mrs. Abbey. God bless you.

Your affectionate Brother,
John.

Do write me a Letter directed to Inverness, Scotland.





LVIII.—TO THOMAS KEATS.
Auchtercairn [for Auchencairn,] 3rd [for 2d] July 1818.

My dear Tom—We are now in Meg Merrilies’s country, and have this morning passed through some parts exactly suited to her. Kirkcudbright County is very beautiful, very wild, with craggy hills, somewhat in the Westmoreland fashion. We have come down from Dumfries to the sea-coast part of it. The following song you will have from Dilke, but perhaps you would like it here.[71]...


[Newton Stewart,] July 5th [for 4th].

Yesterday was passed in Kirkcudbright, the country is very rich, very fine, and with a little of Devon. I am now writing at Newton Stewart, six miles into Wigtown. Our landlady of yesterday said very few southerners passed hereaways. The children jabber away, as if in a foreign language; the bare-footed girls look very much in keeping, I mean with the scenery about them. Brown praises their cleanliness and appearance of comfort, the neatness of their cottages, etc.—it may be—they are very squat among trees and fern and heath and broom, on levels slopes and heights—but I wish they were as snug as those up the Devonshire valleys. We are lodged and entertained in great varieties. We dined yesterday on dirty Bacon, dirtier eggs, and dirtiest potatoes, with a slice of salmon—we breakfast this morning in a nice carpeted room, with sofa, hair-bottomed Chairs, and green-baized Mahogany. A spring by the road-side is always welcome: we drink water for dinner, diluted with a Gill of whisky.

[Pg 124]


[Donaghadee] July 6.

Yesterday morning we set out from Glenluce, going some distance round to see some rivers: they were scarcely worth the while. We went on to Stranraer, in a burning sun, and had gone about six miles when the Mail overtook us: we got up, were at Port Patrick in a jiffey, and I am writing now in little Ireland. The dialects on the neighbouring shores of Scotland and Ireland are much the same, yet I can perceive a great difference in the nations, from the chamber-maid at this nate toone kept by Mr. Kelly. She is fair, kind, and ready to laugh, because she is out of the horrible dominion of the Scotch Kirk. A Scotch girl stands in terrible awe of the Elders—poor little Susannahs, they will scarcely laugh, and their Kirk is greatly to be damned. These Kirk-men have done Scotland good (Query?). They have made men, women; old men, young men; old women, young women; boys, girls; and all infants careful—so that they are formed into regular Phalanges of savers and gainers. Such a thrifty army cannot fail to enrich their Country, and give it a greater appearance of Comfort, than that of their poor rash neighbourhood—these Kirk-men have done Scotland harm; they have banished puns, and laughing, and kissing, etc. (except in cases where the very danger and crime must make it very gustful). I shall make a full stop at kissing, for after that there should be a better parenthesis, and go on to remind you of the fate of Burns—poor unfortunate fellow, his disposition was Southern—how sad it is when a luxurious imagination is obliged, in self-defence, to deaden its delicacy in vulgarity, and rot[72] in things attainable, that it may not have leisure to go mad after things which are not. No man, in such matters, will be content with the experience of others—It is true that out of suffering there is no dignity, no greatness, that in the most abstracted pleasure there is no lasting happiness—Yet who would not like[Pg 125] to discover over again that Cleopatra was a Gipsy, Helen a rogue, and Ruth a deep one? I have not sufficient reasoning faculty to settle the doctrine of thrift, as it is consistent with the dignity of human Society—with the happiness of Cottagers. All I can do is by plump contrasts; were the fingers made to squeeze a guinea or a white hand?—were the lips made to hold a pen or a kiss? and yet in Cities man is shut out from his fellows if he is poor—the cottager must be very dirty, and very wretched, if she be not thrifty—the present state of society demands this, and this convinces me that the world is very young, and in a very ignorant state—We live in a barbarous age—I would sooner be a wild deer, than a girl under the dominion of the Kirk; and I would sooner be a wild hog, than be the occasion of a poor Creature’s penance before those execrable elders.

It is not so far to the Giant’s Causeway as we supposed—We thought it 70, and hear it is only 48 miles—So we shall leave one of our knapsacks here at Donaghadee, take our immediate wants, and be back in a week, when we shall proceed to the County of Ayr. In the Packet yesterday we heard some ballads from two old men—One was a Romance which seemed very poor—then there was “The Battle of the Boyne,” then “Robin Huid,” as they call him—“Before the King you shall go, go, go; before the King you shall go.”


[Stranraer,] July 9th.

We stopped very little in Ireland, and that you may not have leisure to marvel at our speedy return to Port Patrick, I will tell you that it is as dear living in Ireland as at the Hummums—thrice the expense of Scotland—it would have cost us £15 before our return; moreover we found those 48 miles to be Irish ones, which reach to 70 English—so having walked to Belfast one day, and back to Donaghadee the next, we left Ireland with a fair breeze. We slept last night at Port Patrick, when I was gratified by a letter from you. On[Pg 126] our walk in Ireland, we had too much opportunity to see the worse than nakedness, the rags, the dirt and misery, of the poor common Irish—A Scotch cottage, though in that sometimes the smoke has no exit but at the door, is a palace to an Irish one. We could observe that impetuosity in Man and Woman—We had the pleasure of finding our way through a Peat-bog, three miles long at least—dreary, flat, dank, black, and spongy—here and there were poor dirty Creatures, and a few strong men cutting or carting Peat—We heard on passing into Belfast through a most wretched suburb, that most disgusting of all noises, worse than the Bagpipes—the laugh of a Monkey—the chatter of women—the scream of a Macaw—I mean the sound of the Shuttle. What a tremendous difficulty is the improvement of such people. I cannot conceive how a mind “with child” of philanthrophy could grasp at its possibility—with me it is absolute despair—

At a miserable house of entertainment, half-way between Donaghadee and Belfast, were two men sitting at Whisky—one a labourer, and the other I took to be a drunken weaver—the labourer took me to be a Frenchman, and the other hinted at bounty-money; saying he was ready to take it—On calling for the letters at Port Patrick, the man snapped out “what Regiment?” On our return from Belfast we met a sedan—the Duchess of Dunghill. It is no laughing matter though. Imagine the worst dog kennel you ever saw, placed upon two poles from a mouldy fencing—In such a wretched thing sat a squalid old woman, squat like an ape half-starved, from a scarcity of biscuit in its passage from Madagascar to the Cape, with a pipe in her mouth, and looking out with a round-eyed skinny-lidded inanity; with a sort of horizontal idiotic movement of her head—Squat and lean she sat, and puffed out the smoke, while two ragged tattered girls carried her along. What a thing would be a history of her life and sensations; I shall endeavour when I have thought a little more, to[Pg 127] give you my idea of the difference between the Scotch and Irish—The two Irishmen I mentioned were speaking of their treatment in England, when the weaver said—“Ah you were a civil man, but I was a drinker.”

Till further notice you must direct to Inverness.

Your most affectionate Brother
John.





LIX.—TO THOMAS KEATS.
Belantree [for Ballantrae,] July 10

Ah! ken ye what I met the day
Out oure the Mountains
A coming down by craggies gray
An mossie fountains—
Ah goud-hair’d Marie yeve I pray
Ane minute’s guessing—
For that I met upon the way
Is past expressing.
As I stood where a rocky brig
A torrent crosses
I spied upon a misty rig
A troup o’ Horses—
And as they trotted down the glen
I sped to meet them
To see if I might know the Men
To stop and greet them.
First Willie on his sleek mare came
At canting gallop
His long hair rustled like a flame
On board a shallop,
Then came his brother Rab and then
Young Peggy’s Mither
And Peggy too—adown the glen
They went togither—
I saw her wrappit in her hood
Frae wind and raining—
Her cheek was flush wi’ timid blood
Twixt growth and waning—
She turn’d her dazed head full oft
For there her Brithers
Came riding with her Bridegroom soft
And mony ithers.
Young Tam came up and eyed me quick
[Pg 128]With reddened cheek—
Braw Tam was daffed like a chick—
He could na speak—
Ah Marie they are all gane hame
Through blustering weather
An’ every heart is full on flame
An’ light as feather.
Ah! Marie they are all gone hame
Frae happy wadding,
Whilst I—Ah is it not a shame?
Sad tears am shedding.

My dear Tom—The reason for my writing these lines was that Brown wanted to impose a Galloway song upon Dilke—but it won’t do. The subject I got from meeting a wedding just as we came down into this place—where I am afraid we shall be imprisoned a while by the weather. Yesterday we came 27 Miles from Stranraer—entered Ayrshire a little beyond Cairn, and had our path through a delightful Country. I shall endeavour that you may follow our steps in this walk—it would be uninteresting in a Book of Travels—it can not be interesting but by my having gone through it. When we left Cairn our Road lay half way up the sides of a green mountainous shore, full of clefts of verdure and eternally varying—sometimes up sometimes down, and over little Bridges going across green chasms of moss, rock and trees—winding about everywhere. After two or three Miles of this we turned suddenly into a magnificent glen finely wooded in Parts—seven Miles long—with a Mountain stream winding down the Midst—full of cottages in the most happy situations—the sides of the Hills covered with sheep—the effect of cattle lowing I never had so finely. At the end we had a gradual ascent and got among the tops of the Mountains whence in a little time I descried in the Sea Ailsa Rock 940 feet high—it was 15 Miles distant and seemed close upon us. The effect of Ailsa with the peculiar perspective of the Sea in connection with the ground we stood on, and the misty rain then falling gave me a complete Idea of a deluge. Ailsa struck me very suddenly—really I was a little alarmed.

[Pg 129]


[Girvan, same day, July 10.]

Thus far had I written before we set out this morning. Now we are at Girvan 13 Miles north of Belantree. Our Walk has been along a more grand shore to-day than yesterday—Ailsa beside us all the way.—From the heights we could see quite at home Cantire and the large Mountains of Arran, one of the Hebrides. We are in comfortable Quarters. The Rain we feared held up bravely and it has been “fu fine this day.”——To-morrow we shall be at Ayr.


[Kirkoswald, July 11.]

’Tis now the 11th of July and we have come 8 Miles to Breakfast to Kirkoswald. I hope the next Kirk will be Kirk Alloway. I have nothing of consequence to say now concerning our journey—so I will speak as far as I can judge on the Irish and Scotch—I know nothing of the higher Classes—yet I have a persuasion that there the Irish are victorious. As to the profanum vulgus I must incline to the Scotch. They never laugh—but they are always comparatively neat and clean. Their constitutions are not so remote and puzzling as the Irish. The Scotchman will never give a decision on any point—he will never commit himself in a sentence which may be referred to as a meridian in his notion of things—so that you do not know him—and yet you may come in nigher neighbourhood to him than to the Irishman who commits himself in so many places that it dazes your head. A Scotchman’s motive is more easily discovered than an Irishman’s. A Scotchman will go wisely about to deceive you, an Irishman cunningly. An Irishman would bluster out of any discovery to his disadvantage. A Scotchman would retire perhaps without much desire for revenge. An Irishman likes to be thought a gallous fellow. A Scotchman is contented with himself. It seems to me they are both sensible of the Character they hold in England and act accordingly to Englishmen. Thus[Pg 130] the Scotchman will become over grave and over decent and the Irishman over-impetuous. I like a Scotchman best because he is less of a bore—I like the Irishman best because he ought to be more comfortable.—The Scotchman has made up his Mind within himself in a sort of snail shell wisdom. The Irishman is full of strongheaded instinct. The Scotchman is farther in Humanity than the Irishman—there he will stick perhaps when the Irishman will be refined beyond him—for the former thinks he cannot be improved—the latter would grasp at it for ever, place but the good plain before him.


Maybole, [same day, July 11].

Since breakfast we have come only four Miles to dinner, not merely, for we have examined in the way two Ruins, one of them very fine, called Crossraguel Abbey—there is a winding Staircase to the top of a little Watch Tower.


Kingswells, July 13.

I have been writing to Reynolds—therefore any particulars since Kirkoswald have escaped me—from said Kirk we went to Maybole to dinner—then we set forward to Burness’ town Ayr—the approach to it is extremely fine—quite outwent my expectations—richly meadowed, wooded, heathed and rivuleted—with a grand Sea view terminated by the black Mountains of the isle of Arran. As soon as I saw them so nearly I said to myself “How is it they did not beckon Burns to some grand attempt at Epic?”

The bonny Doon is the sweetest river I ever saw—overhung with fine trees as far as we could see—We stood some time on the Brig across it, over which Tam o’ Shanter fled—we took a pinch of snuff on the Key stone—then we proceeded to the “auld Kirk Alloway.” As we were looking at it a Farmer pointed the spots where Mungo’s Mither hang’d hersel’ and “drunken Charlie brake’s neck’s bane.” Then we proceeded to the Cottage he was born in—there was a board to that effect[Pg 131] by the door side—it had the same effect as the same sort of memorial at Stratford on Avon. We drank some Toddy to Burns’s Memory with an old Man who knew Burns—damn him and damn his anecdotes—he was a great bore—it was impossible for a Southron to understand above 5 words in a hundred.—There was something good in his description of Burns’s melancholy the last time he saw him. I was determined to write a sonnet in the Cottage—I did—but it was so bad I cannot venture it here.

Next we walked into Ayr Town and before we went to Tea saw the new Brig and the Auld Brig and Wallace tower. Yesterday we dined with a Traveller. We were talking about Kean. He said he had seen him at Glasgow “in Othello in the Jew, I mean er, er, er, the Jew in Shylock.” He got bother’d completely in vague ideas of the Jew in Othello, Shylock in the Jew, Shylock in Othello, Othello in Shylock, the Jew in Othello, etc. etc. etc.—he left himself in a mess at last.—Still satisfied with himself he went to the Window and gave an abortive whistle of some tune or other—it might have been Handel. There is no end to these Mistakes—he’ll go and tell people how he has seen “Malvolio in the Countess”—“Twelfth night in Midsummer night’s dream”—Bottom in much ado about Nothing—Viola in Barrymore—Antony in Cleopatra—Falstaff in the mouse Trap.—


[Glasgow,] July 14.

We enter’d Glasgow last Evening under the most oppressive Stare a body could feel. When we had crossed the Bridge Brown look’d back and said its whole population had turned out to wonder at us—we came on till a drunken Man came up to me—I put him off with my Arm—he returned all up in Arms saying aloud that, “he had seen all foreigners bu-u-ut he never saw the like o’ me.” I was obliged to mention the word Officer and Police before he would desist.—The City of Glasgow I take to be a very fine[Pg 132] one—I was astonished to hear it was twice the size of Edinburgh. It is built of Stone and has a much more solid appearance than London. We shall see the Cathedral this morning—they have devilled it into “High Kirk.” I want very much to know the name of the ship George is gone in—also what port he will land in—I know nothing about it. I hope you are leading a quiet Life and gradually improving. Make a long lounge of the whole Summer—by the time the Leaves fall I shall be near you with plenty of confab—there are a thousand things I cannot write. Take care of yourself—I mean in not being vexed or bothered at anything.

God bless you!
John ——.





LX.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
Maybole, July 11 [1818].

My dear Reynolds—I’ll not run over the Ground we have passed; that would be merely as bad as telling a dream—unless perhaps I do it in the manner of the Laputan printing press—that is I put down Mountains, Rivers, Lakes, dells, glens, Rocks, and Clouds, with beautiful enchanting, Gothic picturesque fine, delightful, enchanting, Grand, sublime—a few blisters, etc.—and now you have our journey thus far: where I begin a letter to you because I am approaching Burns’s Cottage very fast. We have made continual inquiries from the time we saw his Tomb at Dumfries—his name of course is known all about—his great reputation among the plodding people is, “that he wrote a good mony sensible things.” One of the pleasantest means of annulling self is approaching such a shrine as the Cottage of Burns—we need not think of his misery—that is all gone, bad luck to it—I shall look upon it hereafter with unmixed pleasure, as I do upon my Stratford-on-Avon day with Bailey. I shall fill this sheet for you in the Bardie’s country, going no further than this till I get into the town of Ayr which will be a 9 miles’ walk to Tea.

[Pg 133]


[Kingswells, July 13.]

We were talking on different and indifferent things, when on a sudden we turned a corner upon the immediate Country of Ayr—the Sight was as rich as possible. I had no Conception that the native place of Burns was so beautiful—the idea I had was more desolate, his ‘rigs of Barley’ seemed always to me but a few strips of Green on a cold hill—O prejudice! it was as rich as Devon—I endeavoured to drink in the Prospect, that I might spin it out to you as the Silkworm makes silk from Mulberry leaves—I cannot recollect it—Besides all the Beauty, there were the Mountains of Arran Isle, black and huge over the Sea. We came down upon everything suddenly—there were in our way the ‘bonny Doon,’ with the Brig that Tam o’ Shanter crossed, Kirk Alloway, Burns’s Cottage, and then the Brigs of Ayr. First we stood upon the Bridge across the Doon; surrounded by every Phantasy of green in Tree, Meadow, and Hill,—the stream of the Doon, as a Farmer told us, is covered with trees from head to foot—you know those beautiful heaths so fresh against the weather of a summer’s evening—there was one stretching along behind the trees. I wish I knew always the humour my friends would be in at opening a letter of mine, to suit it to them as nearly as possible. I could always find an egg shell for Melancholy, and as for Merriment a Witty humour will turn anything to Account—My head is sometimes in such a whirl in considering the million likings and antipathies of our Moments—that I can get into no settled strain in my Letters. My Wig! Burns and sentimentality coming across you and Frank Fladgate in the office—O scenery that thou shouldst be crushed between two Puns—As for them I venture the rascalliest in the Scotch Region—I hope Brown does not put them punctually in his journal—If he does I must sit on the cutty-stool all next winter. We went to Kirk Alloway—“a Prophet is no Prophet in his own Country”—We went to the Cottage[Pg 134] and took some Whisky. I wrote a sonnet for the mere sake of writing some lines under the roof—they are so bad I cannot transcribe them—The Man at the Cottage was a great Bore with his Anecdotes—I hate the rascal—his Life consists in fuz, fuzzy, fuzziest—He drinks glasses five for the Quarter and twelve for the hour—he is a mahogany-faced old Jackass who knew Burns—He ought to have been kicked for having spoken to him. He calls himself “a curious old Bitch”—but he is a flat old dog—I should like to employ Caliph Vathek to kick him. O the flummery of a birthplace! Cant! Cant! Cant! It is enough to give a spirit the guts-ache—Many a true word, they say, is spoken in jest—this may be because his gab hindered my sublimity: the flat dog made me write a flat sonnet. My dear Reynolds—I cannot write about scenery and visitings—Fancy is indeed less than a present palpable reality, but it is greater than remembrance—you would lift your eyes from Homer only to see close before you the real Isle of Tenedos—you would rather read Homer afterwards than remember yourself—One song of Burns’s is of more worth to you than all I could think for a whole year in his native country. His Misery is a dead weight upon the nimbleness of one’s quill—I tried to forget it—to drink Toddy without any Care—to write a merry sonnet—it won’t do—he talked with Bitches—he drank with Blackguards, he was miserable—We can see horribly clear, in the works of such a Man his whole life, as if we were God’s spies.—What were his addresses to Jean in the latter part of his life? I should not speak so to you—yet why not—you are not in the same case—you are in the right path, and you shall not be deceived. I have spoken to you against Marriage, but it was general—the Prospect in those matters has been to me so blank, that I have not been unwilling to die—I would not now, for I have inducements to Life—I must see my little Nephews in America, and I must see you marry your lovely Wife. My sensations are sometimes deadened for weeks together—but[Pg 135] believe me I have more than once yearned for the time of your happiness to come, as much as I could for myself after the lips of Juliet.—From the tenor of my occasional rodomontade in chit-chat, you might have been deceived concerning me in these points—upon my soul, I have been getting more and more close to you, every day, ever since I knew you, and now one of the first pleasures I look to is your happy Marriage—the more, since I have felt the pleasure of loving a sister in Law. I did not think it possible to become so much attached in so short a time—Things like these, and they are real, have made me resolve to have a care of my health—you must be as careful.

The rain has stopped us to-day at the end of a dozen Miles, yet we hope to see Loch Lomond the day after to-morrow;—I will piddle out my information, as Rice says, next Winter, at any time when a substitute is wanted for Vingt-un. We bear the fatigue very well—20 Miles a day in general—A Cloud came over us in getting up Skiddaw—I hope to be more lucky in Ben Lomond—and more lucky still in Ben Nevis. What I think you would enjoy is poking about Ruins—sometimes Abbey, sometimes Castle. The short stay we made in Ireland has left few remembrances—but an old woman in a dog-kennel Sedan with a pipe in her Mouth, is what I can never forget—I wish I may be able to give you an idea of her—Remember me to your Mother and Sisters, and tell your Mother how I hope she will pardon me for having a scrap of paper pasted in the Book sent to her. I was driven on all sides and had not time to call on Taylor—So Bailey is coming to Cumberland—well, if you’ll let me know where at Inverness, I will call on my return and pass a little time with him—I am glad ’tis not Scotland—Tell my friends I do all I can for them, that is, drink their healths in Toddy. Perhaps I may have some lines by and by to send you fresh, on your own Letter—Tom has a few to show you.

Your affectionate friend
John Keats.





[Pg 136]

LXI.—TO THOMAS KEATS.
Cairn-something [for Cairndow,] July 17, [1818].

My dear Tom—Here’s Brown going on so that I cannot bring to mind how the two last days have vanished—for example he says The Lady of the Lake went to Rock herself to sleep on Arthur’s seat and the Lord of the Isles coming to Press a Piece.... I told you last how we were stared at in Glasgow—we are not out of the Crowd yet. Steam Boats on Loch Lomond and Barouches on its sides take a little from the Pleasure of such romantic chaps as Brown and I. The Banks of the Clyde are extremely beautiful—the north end of Loch Lomond grand in excess—the entrance at the lower end to the narrow part from a little distance is precious good—the Evening was beautiful nothing could surpass our fortune in the weather—yet was I worldly enough to wish for a fleet of chivalry Barges with Trumpets and Banners just to die away before me into that blue place among the mountains—I must give you an outline as well as I can.[73]

Not B—the Water was a fine Blue silvered and the Mountains a dark purple, the Sun setting aslant behind them—meantime the head of ben Lomond was covered with a rich Pink Cloud. We did not ascend Ben Lomond—the price being very high and a half a day of rest being quite acceptable. We were up at 4 this morning and have walked to breakfast 15 Miles through two Tremendous Glens—at the end of the first there is a place called rest and be thankful which we took for an Inn—it was nothing but a Stone and so we were cheated into 5 more Miles to Breakfast—I have just been bathing in Loch Fyne a salt water Lake opposite the Windows,—quite pat and fresh but for the cursed Gad flies—damn ’em they have been at me ever since I left the Swan and two necks.[74]

[Pg 137] All gentle folks who owe a grudge
To any living thing
Open your ears and stay your trudge
Whilst I in dudgeon sing.

The Gadfly he hath stung me sore—
O may he ne’er sting you!
But we have many a horrid bore
He may sting black and blue.

Has any here an old gray Mare
With three legs all her store,
O put it to her Buttocks bare
And straight she’ll run on four.

Has any here a Lawyer suit
Of 1743,
Take Lawyer’s nose and put it to’t
And you the end will see.

Is there a Man in Parliament
Dumbfounder’d in his speech,
O let his neighbour make a rent
And put one in his breech.

O Lowther how much better thou
Hadst figur’d t’other day
When to the folks thou mad’st a bow
And hadst no more to say.

If lucky Gadfly had but ta’en
His seat upon thine A—e
And put thee to a little pain
To save thee from a worse.

Better than Southey it had been,
Better than Mr. D——,
Better than Wordsworth too, I ween,
Better than Mr. V——.

Forgive me pray good people all
For deviating so—
In spirit sure I had a call—
And now I on will go.

Has any here a daughter fair
Too fond of reading novels,
Too apt to fall in love with care
And charming Mister Lovels,
[Pg 138]
O put a Gadfly to that thing
She keeps so white and pert—
I mean the finger for the ring,
And it will breed a wort.

Has any here a pious spouse
Who seven times a day
Scolds as King David pray’d, to chouse
And have her holy way—

O let a Gadfly’s little sting
Persuade her sacred tongue
That noises are a common thing,
But that her bell has rung.

And as this is the summum bo-
num of all conquering,
I leave “withouten wordes mo”
The Gadfly’s little sting.


[Inverary, July 18.]

Last Evening we came round the End of Loch Fyne to Inverary—the Duke of Argyle’s Castle is very modern magnificent and more so from the place it is in—the woods seem old enough to remember two or three changes in the Crags about them—the Lake was beautiful and there was a Band at a distance by the Castle. I must say I enjoyed two or three common tunes—but nothing could stifle the horrors of a solo on the Bag-pipe—I thought the Beast would never have done.—Yet was I doomed to hear another.—On entering Inverary we saw a Play Bill. Brown was knocked up from new shoes—so I went to the Barn alone where I saw the Stranger accompanied by a Bag-pipe. There they went on about interesting creaters and human nater till the Curtain fell and then came the Bag-pipe. When Mrs. Haller fainted down went the Curtain and out came the Bag-pipe—at the heartrending, shoemending reconciliation the Piper blew amain. I never read or saw this play before; not the Bag-pipe nor the wretched players themselves were[Pg 139] little in comparison with it—thank heaven it has been scoffed at lately almost to a fashion—

Of late two dainties were before me placed
Sweet, holy, pure, sacred and innocent,
From the ninth sphere to me benignly sent
That Gods might know my own particular taste:
First the soft Bag-pipe mourn’d with zealous haste,
The Stranger next with head on bosom bent
Sigh’d; rueful again the piteous Bag-pipe went,
Again the Stranger sighings fresh did waste.
O Bag-pipe thou didst steal my heart away—
O Stranger thou my nerves from Pipe didst charm—
O Bag-pipe thou didst re-assert thy sway—
Again thou Stranger gav’st me fresh alarm—
Alas! I could not choose. Ah! my poor heart
Mumchance art thou with both oblig’d to part.

I think we are the luckiest fellows in Christendom—Brown could not proceed this morning on account of his feet and lo there is thunder and rain.


[Kilmelfort,] July 20th.

For these two days past we have been so badly accommodated more particularly in coarse food that I have not been at all in cue to write. Last night poor Brown with his feet blistered and scarcely able to walk, after a trudge of 20 Miles down the Side of Loch Awe had no supper but Eggs and Oat Cake—we have lost the sight of white bread entirely—Now we had eaten nothing but Eggs all day—about 10 a piece and they had become sickening—To-day we have fared rather better—but no oat Cake wanting—we had a small Chicken and even a good bottle of Port but all together the fare is too coarse—I feel it a little.—Another week will break us in. I forgot to tell you that when we came through Glenside it was early in the morning and we were pleased with the noise of Shepherds, Sheep and dogs in the misty heights close above us—we saw none of them for some time, till two came in sight creeping among the Crags like Emmets, yet their voices came[Pg 140] quite plainly to us—The approach to Loch Awe was very solemn towards nightfall—the first glance was a streak of water deep in the Bases of large black Mountains.—We had come along a complete mountain road, where if one listened there was not a sound but that of Mountain Streams. We walked 20 Miles by the side of Loch Awe—every ten steps creating a new and beautiful picture—sometimes through little wood—there are two islands on the Lake each with a beautiful ruin—one of them rich in ivy.—We are detained this morning by the rain. I will tell you exactly where we are. We are between Loch Craignish and the sea just opposite Long Island.[75] Yesterday our walk was of this description—the near Hills were not very lofty but many of them steep, beautifully wooded—the distant Mountains in the Hebrides very grand, the Saltwater Lakes coming up between Crags and Islands full tide and scarcely ruffled—sometimes appearing as one large Lake, sometimes as three distinct ones in different directions. At one point we saw afar off a rocky opening into the main sea.—We have also seen an Eagle or two. They move about without the least motion of Wings when in an indolent fit.—I am for the first time in a country where a foreign Language is spoken—they gabble away Gaelic at a vast rate—numbers of them speak English. There are not many Kilts in Argyleshire—at Fort William they say a Man is not admitted into Society without one—the Ladies there have a horror at the indecency of Breeches. I cannot give you a better idea of Highland Life than by describing the place we are in. The Inn or public is by far the best house in the immediate neighbourhood. It has a white front with tolerable windows—the table I am[Pg 141] writing on surprises me as being a nice flapped Mahogany one.... You may if you peep see through the floor chinks into the ground rooms. The old Grandmother of the house seems intelligent though not over clean. N.B. No snuff being to be had in the village she made us some. The Guid Man is a rough-looking hardy stout Man who I think does not speak so much English as the Guid wife who is very obliging and sensible and moreover though stockingless has a pair of old Shoes—Last night some Whisky Men sat up clattering Gaelic till I am sure one o’Clock to our great annoyance. There is a Gaelic testament on the Drawers in the next room. White and blue China ware has crept all about here—Yesterday there passed a Donkey laden with tin-pots—opposite the Window there are hills in a Mist—a few Ash trees and a mountain stream at a little distance.—They possess a few head of Cattle.—If you had gone round to the back of the House just now—you would have seen more hills in a Mist—some dozen wretched black Cottages scented of peat smoke which finds its way by the door or a hole in the roof—a girl here and there barefoot. There was one little thing driving Cows down a slope like a mad thing. There was another standing at the cowhouse door rather pretty fac’d all up to the ankles in dirt.


[Oban, July 21.]

We have walk’d 15 Miles in a soaking rain to Oban opposite the Isle of Mull which is so near Staffa we had thought to pass to it—but the expense is 7 Guineas and those rather extorted.—Staffa you see is a fashionable place and therefore every one concerned with it either in this town or the Island are what you call up. ’Tis like paying sixpence for an apple at the playhouse—this irritated me and Brown was not best pleased—we have therefore resolved to set northward for fort William to-morrow morning. I fed upon a bit of white Bread to-day like a Sparrow—it was very fine—I[Pg 142] cannot manage the cursed Oat Cake. Remember me to all and let me hear a good account of you at Inverness—I am sorry Georgy had not those lines. Good-bye.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





LXII.—TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.
Inverary, July 18 [1818].

My dear Bailey—The only day I have had a chance of seeing you when you were last in London I took every advantage of—some devil led you out of the way—Now I have written to Reynolds to tell me where you will be in Cumberland—so that I cannot miss you. And when I see you, the first thing I shall do will be to read that about Milton and Ceres, and Proserpine—for though I am not going after you to John o’ Grot’s, it will be but poetical to say so. And here, Bailey, I will say a few words written in a sane and sober mind, a very scarce thing with me, for they may, hereafter, save you a great deal of trouble about me, which you do not deserve, and for which I ought to be bastinadoed. I carry all matters to an extreme—so that when I have any little vexation, it grows in five minutes into a theme for Sophocles. Then, and in that temper, if I write to any friend, I have so little self-possession that I give him matter for grieving at the very time perhaps when I am laughing at a Pun. Your last letter made me blush for the pain I had given you—I know my own disposition so well that I am certain of writing many times hereafter in the same strain to you—now, you know how far to believe in them. You must allow for Imagination. I know I shall not be able to help it.

I am sorry you are grieved at my not continuing my visits to Little Britain—Yet I think I have as far as a Man can do who has Books to read and subjects to think upon—for that reason I have been nowhere else except to Wentworth Place so nigh at hand—moreover I have[Pg 143] been too often in a state of health that made it prudent not to hazard the night air. Yet, further, I will confess to you that I cannot enjoy Society small or numerous—I am certain that our fair friends are glad I should come for the mere sake of my coming; but I am certain I bring with me a vexation they are better without—If I can possibly at any time feel my temper coming upon me I refrain even from a promised visit. I am certain I have not a right feeling towards women—at this moment, I am striving to be just to them, but I cannot—Is it because they fall so far beneath my boyish Imagination? When I was a schoolboy I thought a fair woman a pure Goddess; my mind was a soft nest in which some one of them slept, though she knew it not. I have no right to expect more than their reality—I thought them ethereal above men—I find them perhaps equal—great by comparison is very small. Insult may be inflicted in more ways than by word or action—One who is tender of being insulted does not like to think an insult against another. I do not like to think insults in a lady’s company—I commit a crime with her which absence would not have known. Is it not extraordinary?—when among men, I have no evil thoughts, no malice, no spleen—I feel free to speak or to be silent—I can listen, and from every one I can learn—my hands are in my pockets, I am free from all suspicion and comfortable. When I am among women, I have evil thoughts, malice, spleen—I cannot speak, or be silent—I am full of suspicions and therefore listen to nothing—I am in a hurry to be gone. You must be charitable and put all this perversity to my being disappointed since my boyhood. Yet with such feelings I am happier alone among crowds of men, by myself, or with a friend or two. With all this, trust me, I have not the least idea that men of different feelings and inclinations are more short-sighted than myself. I never rejoiced more than at my Brother’s marriage, and shall do so at that of any of my friends. I must absolutely get over this—but how? the only way is to find[Pg 144] the root of the evil, and so cure it “with backward mutters of dissevering power”—that is a difficult thing; for an obstinate Prejudice can seldom be produced but from a gordian complication of feelings, which must take time to unravel, and care to keep unravelled. I could say a good deal about this, but I will leave it, in hopes of better and more worthy dispositions—and also content that I am wronging no one, for after all I do think better of womankind than to suppose they care whether Mister John Keats five feet high likes them or not. You appeared to wish to know my moods on this subject—don’t think it a bore my dear fellow, it shall be my Amen. I should not have consented to myself these four months tramping in the highlands, but that I thought it would give me more experience, rub off more prejudice, use to more hardship, identify finer scenes, load me with grander mountains, and strengthen more my reach in Poetry, than would stopping at home among books, even though I should reach Homer. By this time I am comparatively a Mountaineer. I have been among wilds and mountains too much to break out much about their grandeur. I have fed upon oat-cake—not long enough to be very much attached to it.—The first mountains I saw, though not so large as some I have since seen, weighed very solemnly upon me. The effect is wearing away—yet I like them mainly.


[Island of Mull, July 22.]

We have come this Evening with a guide—for without was impossible—into the middle of the Isle of Mull, pursuing our cheap journey to Iona, and perhaps Staffa. We would not follow the common and fashionable mode, from the great Imposition of Expense. We have come over heath and rock, and river and bog, to what in England would be called a horrid place. Yet it belongs to a Shepherd pretty well off perhaps. The family speak not a word but Gaelic, and we have not yet seen their faces for the smoke, which, after visiting every cranny (not excepting my eyes very[Pg 145] much incommoded for writing), finds its way out at the door. I am more comfortable than I could have imagined in such a place, and so is Brown. The people are all very kind—We lost our way a little yesterday; and inquiring at a Cottage, a young woman without a word threw on her cloak and walked a mile in a mizzling rain and splashy way to put us right again.

I could not have had a greater pleasure in these parts than your mention of my sister. She is very much prisoned from me. I am afraid it will be some time before I can take her to many places I wish. I trust we shall see you ere long in Cumberland—At least I hope I shall, before my visit to America, more than once. I intend to pass a whole year there, if I live to the completion of the three next. My sister’s welfare, and the hopes of such a stay in America, will make me observe your advice. I shall be prudent and more careful of my health than I have been. I hope you will be about paying your first visit to Town after settling when we come into Cumberland—Cumberland however will be no distance to me after my present journey. I shall spin to you in a Minute. I begin to get rather a contempt of distances. I hope you will have a nice convenient room for a library. Now you are so well in health, do keep it up by never missing your dinner, by not reading hard, and by taking proper exercise. You’ll have a horse, I suppose, so you must make a point of sweating him. You say I must study Dante—well, the only Books I have with me are those 3 little volumes.[76] I read that fine passage you mention a few days ago. Your letter followed me from Hampstead to Port-Patrick, and thence to Glasgow. You must think me by this time a very pretty fellow. One of the pleasantest bouts we have had was our walk to Burns’s Cottage, over the Doon, and past Kirk Alloway. I had determined to write a Sonnet in the Cottage. I did—but lawk! it was so wretched I destroyed it—however in a few days afterwards I wrote some lines cousin-german[Pg 146] to the circumstance, which I will transcribe, or rather cross-scribe in the front of this.

Reynolds’s illness has made him a new man—he will be stronger than ever—before I left London he was really getting a fat face. Brown keeps on writing volumes of adventures to Dilke. When we get in of an evening and I have perhaps taken my rest on a couple of chairs, he affronts my indolence and Luxury by pulling out of his knapsack 1st his paper—2ndly his pens and last his ink. Now I would not care if he would change a little. I say now why not Bailey, take out his pens first sometimes—But I might as well tell a hen to hold up her head before she drinks instead of afterwards.

Your affectionate Friend,
John Keats.

LINES WRITTEN IN THE HIGHLANDS AFTER A VISIT TO BURNS’S COUNTRY

There is a charm in footing slow across a silent plain,
Where patriot Battle has been fought, where glory had the gain;
There is a pleasure on the heath where Druids old have been,
Where Mantles gray have rustled by and swept the nettles green;
There is a Joy in every spot made known by times of old,
New to the feet, although each tale a hundred times be told;
There is a deeper Joy than all, more solemn in the heart,
More parching to the tongue than all, of more divine a smart,
When weary steps forget themselves, upon a pleasant turf,
Upon hot sand, or flinty road, or sea-shore iron scurf,
Toward the Castle, or the Cot, where long ago was born
One who was great through mortal days, and died of fame unshorn.
Light heather-bells may tremble then, but they are far away;
Wood-lark may sing from sandy fern,—the sun may hear his Lay;
Runnels may kiss the grass on shelves and shallows clear,
But their low voices are not heard, though come on travels drear;
Blood-red the sun may set behind black mountain peaks;
Blue tides may sluice and drench their time in Caves and weedy creeks;
Eagles may seem to sleep wing-wide upon the Air;
Ring-doves may fly convuls’d across to some high-cedar’d lair;
But the forgotten eye is still fast lidded to the ground,
As Palmer’s, that, with weariness, mid-desert shrine hath found.
At such a time the Soul’s a child, in childhood is the brain;
[Pg 147]Forgotten is the worldly heart—alone, it beats in vain.—
Aye, if a Madman could have leave to pass a healthful day
To tell his forehead’s swoon and faint when first began decay,
He might make tremble many a one whose spirit had gone forth
To find a Bard’s low cradle-place about the silent North.
Scanty the hour and few the steps beyond the bourn of Care,
Beyond the sweet and bitter world,—beyond it unaware!
Scanty the hour and few the steps, because a longer stay
Would bar return, and make a man forget his mortal way:
O horrible! to lose the sight of well remember’d face,
Of Brother’s eyes, of Sister’s brow—constant to every place;
Filling the Air, as on we move, with Portraiture intense;
More warm than those heroic tints that pain a Painter’s sense,
When shapes of old come striding by, and visages of old,
Locks shining black, hair scanty gray, and passions manifold.
No No, that horror cannot be, for at the cable’s length
Man feels the gentle anchor pull and gladdens in its strength:—
One hour, half-idiot, he stands by mossy waterfall,
But in the very next he reads his soul’s Memorial:—
He reads it on the mountain’s height, where chance he may sit down
Upon rough marble diadem—that hill’s eternal Crown.
Yet be his Anchor e’er so fast, room is there for a prayer
That man may never lose his Mind on Mountains black and bare;
That he may stray league after league some Great birthplace to find
And keep his vision clear from speck, his inward sight unblind.





LXIII.—TO THOMAS KEATS.
Dun an cullen,[77] Island of Mull [July 23, 1818].

My dear Tom—Just after my last had gone to the Post, in came one of the Men with whom we endeavoured to agree about going to Staffa—he said what a pity it was we should turn aside and not see the curiosities. So we had a little talk, and finally agreed that he should be our guide across the Isle of Mull. We set out, crossed two ferries—one to the Isle of Kerrara, of little distance; the other from Kerrara to Mull 9 Miles across—we did it[Pg 148] in forty minutes with a fine Breeze. The road through the Island, or rather the track, is the most dreary you can think of—between dreary Mountains, over bog and rock and river with our Breeches tucked up and our Stockings in hand. About 8 o’Clock we arrived at a shepherd’s Hut, into which we could scarcely get for the Smoke through a door lower than my Shoulders. We found our way into a little compartment with the rafters and turf-thatch blackened with smoke, the earth floor full of Hills and Dales. We had some white Bread with us, made a good supper, and slept in our Clothes in some Blankets; our Guide snored on another little bed about an Arm’s length off. This morning we came about sax Miles to Breakfast, by rather a better path, and we are now in by comparison a Mansion. Our Guide is I think a very obliging fellow—in the way this morning he sang us two Gaelic songs—one made by a Mrs. Brown on her husband’s being drowned, the other a jacobin one on Charles Stuart. For some days Brown has been enquiring out his Genealogy here—he thinks his Grandfather came from long Island. He got a parcel of people about him at a Cottage door last Evening, chatted with ane who had been a Miss Brown, and who I think from a likeness, must have been a Relation—he jawed with the old Woman—flattered a young one—kissed a child who was afraid of his Spectacles and finally drank a pint of Milk. They handle his Spectacles as we do a sensitive leaf.


[Oban,] July 26th.

Well—we had a most wretched walk of 37 Miles across the Island of Mull and then we crossed to Iona or Icolmkill—from Icolmkill we took a boat at a bargain to take us to Staffa and land us at the head of Loch Nakgal,[78] whence we should only have to walk half the distance to Oban again and on a better road. All this is well passed and done, with this singular piece of Luck, that there was an interruption in the bad[Pg 149] Weather just as we saw Staffa at which it is impossible to land but in a tolerable Calm sea. But I will first mention Icolmkill—I know not whether you have heard much about this Island; I never did before I came nigh it. It is rich in the most interesting Antiquities. Who would expect to find the ruins of a fine Cathedral Church, of Cloisters Colleges Monasteries and Nunneries in so remote an Island? The Beginning of these things was in the sixth Century, under the superstition of a would-be-Bishop-saint, who landed from Ireland, and chose the spot from its Beauty—for at that time the now treeless place was covered with magnificent Woods. Columba in the Gaelic is Colm, signifying Dove—Kill signifies church, and I is as good as Island—so I-colm-kill means the Island of Saint Columba’s Church. Now this Saint Columba became the Dominic of the barbarian Christians of the north and was famed also far south—but more especially was reverenced by the Scots the Picts the Norwegians the Irish. In a course of years perhaps the Island was considered the most holy ground of the north, and the old Kings of the aforementioned nations chose it for their burial-place. We were shown a spot in the Churchyard where they say 61 Kings are buried 48 Scotch from Fergus II. to Macbeth 8 Irish 4 Norwegians and 1 French—they lie in rows compact. Then we were shown other matters of later date, but still very ancient—many tombs of Highland Chieftains—their effigies in complete armour, face upwards, black and moss-covered—Abbots and Bishops of the island always of one of the chief Clans. There were plenty Macleans and Macdonnels; among these latter, the famous Macdonel Lord of the Isles. There have been 300 Crosses in the Island but the Presbyterians destroyed all but two, one of which is a very fine one, and completely covered with a shaggy coarse Moss. The old Schoolmaster, an ignorant little man but reckoned very clever, showed us these things. He is a Maclean, and as much above 4 foot as he is under 4 foot three[Pg 150] inches. He stops at one glass of whisky unless you press another and at the second unless you press a third—

I am puzzled how to give you an Idea of Staffa. It can only be represented by a first-rate drawing. One may compare the surface of the Island to a roof—this roof is supported by grand pillars of basalt standing together as thick as honeycombs. The finest thing is Fingal’s Cave—it is entirely a hollowing out of Basalt Pillars. Suppose now the Giants who rebelled against Jove had taken a whole Mass of black Columns and bound them together like bunches of matches—and then with immense axes had made a cavern in the body of these columns—Of course the roof and floor must be composed of the broken ends of the Columns—such is Fingal’s Cave, except that the Sea has done the work of excavations, and is continually dashing there—so that we walk along the sides of the cave on the pillars which are left as if for convenient stairs. The roof is arched somewhat gothic-wise, and the length of some of the entire side-pillars is fifty feet. About the island you might seat an army of Men each on a pillar. The length of the Cave is 120 feet, and from its extremity the view into the sea, through the large Arch at the entrance—the colour of the columns is a sort of black with a lurking gloom of purple therein. For solemnity and grandeur it far surpasses the finest Cathedral. At the extremity of the Cave there is a small perforation into another cave, at which the waters meeting and buffeting each other there is sometimes produced a report as of a cannon heard as far as Iona, which must be 12 Miles. As we approached in the boat, there was such a fine swell of the sea that the pillars appeared rising immediately out of the crystal. But it is impossible to describe it—

Not Aladdin magian
Ever such a work began.
Not the Wizard of the Dee
[Pg 151]Ever such a dream could see,
Not St. John in Patmos Isle
In the passion of his toil
When he saw the churches seven
Golden-aisled built up in heaven
Gaz’d at such a rugged wonder.
As I stood its roofing under
Lo! I saw one sleeping there
On the marble cold and bare.
While the surges wash’d his feet
And his garments white did beat
Drench’d about the sombre rocks,
On his neck his well-grown locks
Lifted dry above the Main
Were upon the curl again—
“What is this? and what art thou?”
Whisper’d I, and touch’d his brow;
“What art thou? and what is this?”
Whisper’d I, and strove to kiss
The Spirit’s hand, to wake his eyes;
Up he started in a trice:
“I am Lycidas,” said he,
“Fam’d in funeral Minstrelsy—
This was architected thus
By the great Oceanus.
Here his mighty waters play
Hollow Organs all the day,
Here, by turns, his dolphins all,
Finny palmers great and small,
Come to pay devotion due—
Each a mouth of pearls must strew!
Many a Mortal of these days
Dares to pass our sacred ways,
Dares to touch, audaciously
This Cathedral of the sea—
I have been the Pontiff-priest,
Where the Waters never rest,
Where a fledgy sea-bird choir
Soars for ever—holy fire
I have hid from Mortal Man.
Proteus is my Sacristan.
But the stupid eye of Mortal
Hath pass’d beyond the Rocky portal.
So for ever will I leave
Such a taint and soon unweave
All the magic of the place—
’Tis now free to stupid face—
[Pg 152]To cutters and to fashion boats,
To cravats and to Petticoats.
The great Sea shall war it down,
For its fame shall not be blown
At every farthing quadrille dance.”[79]
So saying with a Spirit’s glance
He dived——

I am sorry I am so indolent as to write such stuff as this. It can’t be helped. The western coast of Scotland is a most strange place—it is composed of rocks, Mountains, mountainous and rocky Islands intersected by lochs—you can go but a short distance anywhere from salt water in the highlands.

I have a slight sore throat and think it best to stay a day or two at Oban—then we shall proceed to Fort William and Inverness, where I am anxious to be on account of a Letter from you. Brown in his Letters puts down every little circumstance. I should like to do the same, but I confess myself too indolent, and besides next winter everything will come up in prime order as we verge on such and such things.

Have you heard in any way of George? I should think by this time he must have landed. I in my carelessness never thought of knowing where a letter would find him on the other side—I think Baltimore, but I am afraid of directing it to the wrong place. I shall begin some chequer work for him directly, and it will be ripe for the post by the time I hear from you next after this. I assure you I often long for a seat and a Cup o’ tea at Well Walk, especially now that mountains, castles, and Lakes are becoming common to me. Yet I would rather summer it out, for on the whole I am happier than when I have time to be glum—perhaps it may cure me. Immediately on my return I shall begin studying hard, with a peep at the theatre now and then—and depend upon it I shall be very luxurious. With respect to Women I think I shall be able to conquer my passions[Pg 153] hereafter better than I have yet done. You will help me to talk of George next winter, and we will go now and then to see Fanny. Let me hear a good account of your health and comfort, telling me truly how you do alone. Remember me to all including Mr. and Mrs. Bentley.

Your most affectionate Brother
John.





LXIV.—TO THOMAS KEATS.
Letter Findlay, August 3 [1818].

Ah mio Ben.

My dear Tom—We have made but poor progress lately, chiefly from bad weather, for my throat is in a fair way of getting quite well, so I have had nothing of consequence to tell you till yesterday when we went up Ben Nevis, the highest Mountain in Great Britain. On that account I will never ascend another in this empire—Skiddaw is nothing to it either in height or in difficulty. It is above 4300 feet from the Sea level, and Fortwilliam stands at the head of a Salt water Lake, consequently we took it completely from that level. I am heartily glad it is done—it is almost like a fly crawling up a wainscoat. Imagine the task of mounting ten Saint Pauls without the convenience of Staircases. We set out about five in the morning with a Guide in the Tartan and Cap, and soon arrived at the foot of the first ascent which we immediately began upon. After much fag and tug and a rest and a glass of whisky apiece we gained the top of the first rise and saw then a tremendous chap above us, which the guide said was still far from the top. After the first Rise our way lay along a heath valley in which there was a Loch—after about a Mile in this Valley we began upon the next ascent, more formidable by far than the last, and kept mounting with short intervals of rest until we got above all vegetation, among nothing but loose Stones which lasted us to the very top. The Guide said we had three Miles of a stony ascent—we gained the[Pg 154] first tolerable level after the valley to the height of what in the Valley we had thought the top and saw still above us another huge crag which still the Guide said was not the top—to that we made with an obstinate fag, and having gained it there came on a Mist, so that from that part to the very top we walked in a Mist. The whole immense head of the Mountain is composed of large loose stones—thousands of acres. Before we had got halfway up we passed large patches of snow and near the top there is a chasm some hundred feet deep completely glutted with it.—Talking of chasms they are the finest wonder of the whole—they appear great rents in the very heart of the mountain though they are not, being at the side of it, but other huge crags arising round it give the appearance to Nevis of a shattered heart or Core in itself. These Chasms are 1500 feet in depth and are the most tremendous places I have ever seen—they turn one giddy if you choose to give way to it. We tumbled in large stones and set the echoes at work in fine style. Sometimes these chasms are tolerably clear, sometimes there is a misty cloud which seems to steam up and sometimes they are entirely smothered with clouds.

After a little time the Mist cleared away but still there were large Clouds about attracted by old Ben to a certain distance so as to form as it appeared large dome curtains which kept sailing about, opening and shutting at intervals here and there and everywhere: so that although we did not see one vast wide extent of prospect all round we saw something perhaps finer—these cloud-veils opening with a dissolving motion and showing us the mountainous region beneath as through a loophole—these cloudy loopholes ever varying and discovering fresh prospect east, west, north and south. Then it was misty again, and again it was fair—then puff came a cold breeze of wind and bared a craggy chap we had not yet seen though in close neighbourhood. Every now and then we had overhead blue Sky clear and the sun pretty warm. I do not know whether I can give you an Idea of[Pg 155] the prospect from a large Mountain top. You are on a stony plain which of course makes you forget you are on any but low ground—the horizon or rather edges of this plain being above 4000 feet above the Sea hide all the Country immediately beneath you, so that the next object you see all round next to the edges of the flat top are the Summits of Mountains of some distance off. As you move about on all sides you see more or less of the near neighbour country according as the Mountain you stand upon is in different parts steep or rounded—but the most new thing of all is the sudden leap of the eye from the extremity of what appears a plain into so vast a distance. On one part of the top there is a handsome pile of Stones done pointedly by some soldiers of artillery; I clim[b]ed on to them and so got a little higher than old Ben himself. It was not so cold as I expected—yet cold enough for a glass of Whisky now and then. There is not a more fickle thing than the top of a Mountain—what would a Lady give to change her head-dress as often and with as little trouble!—There are a good many red deer upon Ben Nevis—we did not see one—the dog we had with us kept a very sharp look out and really languished for a bit of a worry. I have said nothing yet of our getting on among the loose stones large and small sometimes on two, sometimes on three, sometimes four legs—sometimes two and stick, sometimes three and stick, then four again, then two, then a jump, so that we kept on ringing changes on foot, hand, stick, jump, boggle, stumble, foot, hand, foot (very gingerly), stick again, and then again a game at all fours. After all there was one Mrs. Cameron of 50 years of age and the fattest woman in all Inverness-shire who got up this Mountain some few years ago—true she had her servants—but then she had her self. She ought to have hired Sisyphus,—“Up the high hill he heaves a huge round—Mrs. Cameron.” ’Tis said a little conversation took place between the mountain and the Lady. After taking a glass of Whisky as she was tolerably seated at ease she thus began—

[Pg 156]Mrs. C.

Upon my Life Sir Nevis I am pique’d
That I have so far panted tugg’d and reek’d
To do an honor to your old bald pate
And now am sitting on you just to bait,
Without your paying me one compliment.
Alas ’tis so with all, when our intent
Is plain, and in the eye of all Mankind
We fair ones show a preference, too blind!
You Gentle man immediately turn tail—
O let me then my hapless fate bewail!
Ungrateful Baldpate have I not disdain’d
The pleasant Valleys—have I not madbrain’d
Deserted all my Pickles and preserves
My China closet too—with wretched Nerves
To boot—say wretched ingrate have I not
Left my soft cushion chair and caudle pot.
’Tis true I had no corns—no! thank the fates
My Shoemaker was always Mr. Bates.
And if not Mr. Bates why I’m not old!
Still dumb ungrateful Nevis—still so cold!

Here the Lady took some more whisky and was putting even more to her lips when she dashed it to the Ground for the Mountain began to grumble—which continued for a few minutes before he thus began—

Ben Nevis.

What whining bit of tongue and Mouth thus dares
Disturb my slumber of a thousand years?
Even so long my sleep has been secure—
And to be so awaked I’ll not endure.
Oh pain—for since the Eagle’s earliest scream
I’ve had a damn’d confounded ugly dream,
A Nightmare sure. What Madam was it you?
It cannot be! My old eyes are not true!
Red-Crag, my Spectacles! Now let me see!
Good Heavens Lady how the gemini
Did you get here? O I shall split my sides!
I shall earthquake——

Mrs. C.

Sweet Nevis do not quake, for though I love
[Pg 157]Your honest Countenance all things above
Truly I should not like to be convey’d
So far into your Bosom—gentle Maid
Loves not too rough a treatment gentle Sir—
Pray thee be calm and do not quake nor stir
No not a Stone or I shall go in fits—

Ben Nevis.

I must—I shall—I meet not such tit bits—
I meet not such sweet creatures every day—
By my old night cap night cap night and day
I must have one sweet Buss—I must and shall!
Red Crag!—What Madam can you then repent
Of all the toil and vigour you have spent
To see Ben Nevis and to touch his nose?
Red Crag I say! O I must have them close!
Red Crag, there lies beneath my furthest toe
A vein of Sulphur—go dear Red Crag, go—
And rub your flinty back against it—budge!
Dear Madam I must kiss you, faith I must!
I must Embrace you with my dearest gust!
Block-head, d’ye hear—Block-head I’ll make her feel
There lies beneath my east leg’s northern heel
A cave of young earth dragons—well my boy
Go thither quick and so complete my joy
Take you a bundle of the largest pines
And when the sun on fiercest Phosphor shines
Fire them and ram them in the Dragon’s nest
Then will the dragons fry and fizz their best
Until ten thousand now no bigger than
Poor Alligators—poor things of one span—
Will each one swell to twice ten times the size
Of northern whale—then for the tender prize—
The moment then—for then will Red Crag rub
His flinty back—and I shall kiss and snub
And press my dainty morsel to my breast.
Block-head make haste!
O Muses weep the rest—
The Lady fainted and he thought her dead
So pulled the clouds again about his head
And went to sleep again—soon she was rous’d
By her affrighted servants—next day hous’d
Safe on the lowly ground she bless’d her fate
That fainting fit was not delayed too late.

But what surprises me above all is how this Lady got down again. I felt it horribly. ’Twas the most vile[Pg 158] descent—shook me all to pieces. Over leaf you will find a Sonnet I wrote on the top of Ben Nevis. We have just entered Inverness. I have three Letters from you and one from Fanny—and one from Dilke. I would set about crossing this all over for you but I will first write to Fanny and Mrs. Wylie. Then I will begin another to you and not before because I think it better you should have this as soon as possible. My Sore throat is not quite well and I intend stopping here a few days.

Read me a lesson, Muse, and speak it loud
Upon the top of Nevis, blind in mist!
I look into the chasms, and a shroud
Vapourous doth hide them,—just so much I wist
Mankind do know of hell; I look o’erhead,
And there is sullen mist,—even so much
Mankind can tell of heaven; mist is spread
Before the earth, beneath me,—even such,
Even so vague is man’s sight of himself!
Here are the craggy stones beneath my feet,—
Thus much I know that, a poor witless elf,
I tread on them,—that all my eye doth meet
Is mist and crag, not only on this height,
But in the world of thought and mental might!

Good-bye till to-morrow.

Your most affectionate Brother
John ——.





LXV.—TO MRS. WYLIE.
Inverness, August 6 [1818].

My dear Madam—It was a great regret to me that I should leave all my friends, just at the moment when I might have helped to soften away the time for them. I wanted not to leave my brother Tom, but more especially, believe me, I should like to have remained near you, were it but for an atom of consolation after parting with so dear a daughter. My brother George has ever been more than a brother to me; he has been my greatest friend, and I can never forget the sacrifice you have made for his happiness. As I walk along the Mountains here I am[Pg 159] full of these things, and lay in wait, as it were, for the pleasure of seeing you immediately on my return to town. I wish, above all things, to say a word of Comfort to you, but I know not how. It is impossible to prove that black is white; it is impossible to make out that sorrow is joy, or joy is sorrow.

Tom tells me that you called on Mr. Haslam, with a newspaper giving an account of a gentleman in a Fur cap falling over a precipice in Kirkcudbrightshire. If it was me, I did it in a dream, or in some magic interval between the first and second cup of tea; which is nothing extraordinary when we hear that Mahomet, in getting out of Bed, upset a jug of water, and, whilst it was falling, took a fortnight’s trip, as it seemed, to Heaven; yet was back in time to save one drop of water being spilt. As for Fur caps, I do not remember one beside my own, except at Carlisle: this was a very good Fur cap I met in High Street, and I daresay was the unfortunate one. I daresay that the fates, seeing but two Fur caps in the north, thought it too extraordinary, and so threw the dies which of them should be drowned. The lot fell upon Jones: I daresay his name was Jones. All I hope is that the gaunt Ladies said not a word about hanging; if they did I shall repent that I was not half-drowned in Kirkcudbright. Stop! let me see!—being half-drowned by falling from a precipice, is a very romantic affair: why should I not take it to myself? How glorious to be introduced in a drawing-room to a Lady who reads Novels, with “Mr. So-and-so—Miss So-and-so; Miss So-and-so, this is Mr. So-and-so, who fell off a precipice and was half-drowned.” Now I refer to you, whether I should lose so fine an opportunity of making my fortune. No romance lady could resist me—none. Being run under a Waggon—side-lamed in a playhouse, Apoplectic through Brandy—and a thousand other tolerably decent things for badness, would be nothing, but being tumbled over a precipice into the sea—oh! it would make my fortune—especially if you could contrive to hint, from this bulletin’s authority, that[Pg 160] I was not upset on my own account, but that I dashed into the waves after Jessy of Dumblane, and pulled her out by the hair. But that, alas! she was dead, or she would have made me happy with her hand—however in this you may use your own discretion. But I must leave joking, and seriously aver, that I have been very romantic indeed among these Mountains and Lakes. I have got wet through, day after day—eaten oat-cake, and drank Whisky—walked up to my knees in Bog—got a sore throat—gone to see Icolmkill and Staffa; met with wholesome food just here and there as it happened—went up Ben Nevis, and—N.B., came down again. Sometimes when I am rather tired I lean rather languishingly on a rock, and long for some famous Beauty to get down from her Palfrey in passing, approach me, with—her saddle-bags, and give me—a dozen or two capital roastbeef Sandwiches.

When I come into a large town, you know there is no putting one’s Knapsack into one’s fob, so the people stare. We have been taken for Spectacle-vendors, Razor-sellers, Jewellers, travelling linendrapers, Spies, Excisemen, and many things I have no idea of. When I asked for letters at Port Patrick, the man asked what regiment? I have had a peep also at little Ireland. Tell Henry I have not camped quite on the bare Earth yet, but nearly as bad, in walking through Mull, for the Shepherds’ huts you can scarcely breathe in, for the Smoke which they seem to endeavour to preserve for smoking on a large scale. Besides riding about 400, we have walked above 600 Miles, and may therefore reckon ourselves as set out.

I assure you, my dear Madam, that one of the greatest pleasures I shall have on my return, will be seeing you, and that I shall ever be

Yours, with the greatest respect and sincerity,
John Keats.

LXVI.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Hampstead, August 18 [1818].

My dear Fanny—I am afraid you will think me very negligent in not having answered your Letter—I see it is dated June 12. I did not arrive at Inverness till the 8th of this Month so I am very much concerned at your being disappointed so long a time. I did not intend to have returned to London so soon but have a bad sore throat from a cold I caught in the island of Mull: therefore I thought it best to get home as soon as possible, and went on board the Smack from Cromarty. We had a nine days’ passage and were landed at London Bridge yesterday. I shall have a good deal to tell you about Scotland—I would begin here but I have a confounded toothache. Tom has not been getting better since I left London and for the last fortnight has been worse than ever—he has been getting a little better for these two or three days. I shall ask Mr. Abbey to let me bring you to Hampstead. If Mr. A. should see this Letter tell him that he still must if he pleases forward the Post Bill to Perth as I have empowered my fellow traveller to receive it. I have a few Scotch pebbles for you from the Island of Icolmkill—I am afraid they are rather shabby—I did not go near the Mountain of Cairn Gorm. I do not know the Name of George’s ship—the Name of the Port he has gone to is Philadelphia whence he will travel to the Settlement across the Country—I will tell you all about this when I see you. The Title of my last Book is Endymion—you shall have one soon.—I would not advise you to play on the Flageolet—however I will get you one if you please. I will speak to Mr. Abbey on what you say concerning school. I am sorry for your poor Canary. You shall have another volume of my first Book. My toothache keeps on so that I cannot write with any pleasure—all I can say now is that your Letter is a very nice one without fault and[Pg 162] that you will hear from or see in a few days if his throat will let him,

Your affectionate Brother
John.





LXVII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Hampstead, Tuesday [August 25, 1818].

My dear Fanny—I have just written to Mr. Abbey to ask him to let you come and see poor Tom who has lately been much worse. He is better at present—sends his Love to you and wishes much to see you—I hope he will shortly—I have not been able to come to Walthamstow on his account as well as a little Indisposition of my own. I have asked Mr. A. to write me—if he does not mention anything of it to you, I will tell you what reasons he has though I do not think he will make any objection. Write me what you want with a Flageolet and I will get one ready for you by the time you come.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





LXVIII.—TO JANE REYNOLDS.
Well Walk, September 1st [1818].

My dear Jane—Certainly your kind note would rather refresh than trouble me, and so much the more would your coming if as you say, it could be done without agitating my Brother too much. Receive on your Hearth our deepest thanks for your Solicitude concerning us.

I am glad John is not hurt, but gone safe into Devonshire—I shall be in great expectation of his Letter—but the promise of it in so anxious and friendly a way I prize more than a hundred. I shall be in town to-day on some business with my guardian “as was” with scarce a hope of being able to call on you. For these two last days Tom has been more cheerful: you shall hear again soon how he will be.

Remember us particularly to your Mother.

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





[Pg 163]

LXIX.—TO CHARLES WENTWORTH DILKE.
[Hampstead, September 21 1818.]

My dear Dilke—According to the Wentworth place Bulletin you have left Brighton much improved: therefore now a few lines will be more of a pleasure than a bore. I have things to say to you, and would fain begin upon them in this fourth line: but I have a Mind too well regulated to proceed upon anything without due preliminary remarks.—You may perhaps have observed that in the simple process of eating radishes I never begin at the root but constantly dip the little green head in the salt—that in the Game of Whist if I have an ace I constantly play it first. So how can I with any face begin without a dissertation on letter-writing? Yet when I consider that a sheet of paper contains room only for three pages and a half, how can I do justice to such a pregnant subject? However, as you have seen the history of the world stamped as it were by a diminishing glass in the form of a chronological Map, so will I “with retractile claws” draw this into the form of a table—whereby it will occupy merely the remainder of this first page—

Folio—Parsons, Lawyers, Statesmen, Physicians out of place—ut—Eustace—Thornton—out of practice or on their travels.

Foolscap—1. Superfine—Rich or noble poets—ut Byron. 2. common ut egomet.

Quarto—Projectors, Patentees, Presidents, Potato growers.

Bath—Boarding schools, and suburbans in general.

Gilt edge—Dandies in general, male, female, and literary.

Octavo or tears—All who make use of a lascivious seal.

Duodec.—May be found for the most part on Milliners’ and Dressmakers’ Parlour tables.

[Pg 164]

Strip—At the Playhouse-doors, or anywhere.

Slip—Being but a variation.

Snip—So called from its size being disguised by a twist.

I suppose you will have heard that Hazlitt has on foot a prosecution against Blackwood. I dined with him a few days since at Hessey’s—there was not a word said about it, though I understand he is excessively vexed. Reynolds, by what I hear, is almost over-happy, and Rice is in town. I have not seen him, nor shall I for some time, as my throat has become worse after getting well, and I am determined to stop at home till I am quite well. I was going to Town to-morrow with Mrs. D. but I thought it best to ask her excuse this morning. I wish I could say Tom was any better. His identity presses upon me so all day that I am obliged to go out—and although I intended to have given some time to study alone, I am obliged to write and plunge into abstract images to ease myself of his countenance, his voice, and feebleness—so that I live now in a continual fever. It must be poisonous to life, although I feel well. Imagine “the hateful siege of contraries”—if I think of fame, of poetry, it seems a crime to me, and yet I must do so or suffer. I am sorry to give you pain—I am almost resolved to burn this—but I really have not self-possession and magnanimity enough to manage the thing otherwise—after all it may be a nervousness proceeding from the Mercury.

Bailey I hear is gaining his spirits, and he will yet be what I once thought impossible, a cheerful Man—I think he is not quite so much spoken of in Little Britain. I forgot to ask Mrs. Dilke if she had anything she wanted to say immediately to you. This morning look’d so unpromising that I did not think she would have gone—but I find she has, on sending for some volumes of Gibbon. I was in a little funk yesterday, for I sent in an unseal’d note of sham abuse, until I recollected, from[Pg 165] what I heard Charles say, that the servant could neither read nor write—not even to her Mother as Charles observed. I have just had a Letter from Reynolds—he is going on gloriously. The following is a translation of a line of Ronsard—

Love pour’d her beauty into my warm veins.

You have passed your Romance, and I never gave in to it, or else I think this line a feast for one of your Lovers. How goes it with Brown?

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





LXX.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
[Hampstead, about September 22, 1818.]

My dear Reynolds—Believe me I have rather rejoiced at your happiness than fretted at your silence. Indeed I am grieved on your account that I am not at the same time happy—But I conjure you to think at Present of nothing but pleasure—“Gather the rose, etc.”—gorge the honey of life. I pity you as much that it cannot last for ever, as I do myself now drinking bitters. Give yourself up to it—you cannot help it—and I have a Consolation in thinking so. I never was in love—Yet the voice and shape of a Woman has haunted me these two days[80]—at such a time, when the relief, the feverous relief of Poetry seems a much less crime—This morning Poetry has conquered—I have relapsed into those abstractions which are my only life—I feel escaped from a new strange and threatening sorrow—And I am thankful for it—There is an awful warmth about my heart like a load of Immortality.

Poor Tom—that woman—and Poetry were ringing changes in my senses—Now I am in comparison happy—I am sensible this will distress you—you must forgive me. Had I known you would have set out so soon I[Pg 166] could have sent you the ‘Pot of Basil’ for I had copied it out ready.—Here is a free translation of a Sonnet of Ronsard, which I think will please you—I have the loan of his works—they have great Beauties.

Nature withheld Cassandra in the skies,
For more adornment, a full thousand years;
She took their cream of Beauty’s fairest dyes,
And shap’d and tinted her above all Peers:
Meanwhile Love kept her dearly with his wings,
And underneath their shadow fill’d her eyes
With such a richness that the cloudy Kings
Of high Olympus utter’d slavish sighs.
When from the Heavens I saw her first descend,
My heart took fire, and only burning pains,
They were my pleasures—they my Life’s sad end;
Love pour’d her beauty into my warm veins.
* * * * *
* * * * *

I had not the original by me when I wrote it, and did not recollect the purport of the last lines.

I should have seen Rice ere this—but I am confined by Sawrey’s mandate in the house now, and have as yet only gone out in fear of the damp night.—You know what an undangerous matter it is. I shall soon be quite recovered—Your offer I shall remember as though it had even now taken place in fact—I think it cannot be. Tom is not up yet—I cannot say he is better. I have not heard from George.

Your affectionate friend
John Keats.





LXXI.—TO FANNY KEATS.
[Hampstead, October 9, 1818.]

My dear Fanny—Poor Tom is about the same as when you saw him last; perhaps weaker—were it not for that I should have been over to pay you a visit these fine days. I got to the stage half an hour before it set out and counted the buns and tarts in a Pastry-cook’s window and was just beginning with the Jellies. There[Pg 167] was no one in the Coach who had a Mind to eat me like Mr. Sham-deaf. I shall be punctual in enquiring about next Thursday—

Your affectionate Brother
John.





LXXII.—TO JAMES AUGUSTUS HESSEY.
[Hampstead, October 9, 1818.]

My dear Hessey—You are very good in sending me the letters from the Chronicle—and I am very bad in not acknowledging such a kindness sooner—pray forgive me. It has so chanced that I have had that paper every day—I have seen to-day’s. I cannot but feel indebted to those Gentlemen who have taken my part—As for the rest, I begin to get a little acquainted with my own strength and weakness.—Praise or blame has but a momentary effect on the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a severe critic on his own Works. My own domestic criticism has given me pain without comparison beyond what Blackwood or the Quarterly could possibly inflict—and also when I feel I am right, no external praise can give me such a glow as my own solitary reperception and ratification of what is fine. J. S. is perfectly right in regard to the slip-shod Endymion.[81] That it is so is no fault of mine. No!—though it may sound a little paradoxical. It is as good as I had power to make it—by myself—Had I been nervous about its being a perfect piece, and with that view asked advice, and trembled over every page, it would not have been written; for it is not in my nature to fumble—I will write independently.—I have written independently without Judgment. I may write independently, and with Judgment, hereafter. The Genius of Poetry must work[Pg 168] out its own salvation in a man: It cannot be matured by law and precept, but by sensation and watchfulness in itself—That which is creative must create itself—In Endymion, I leaped headlong into the sea, and thereby have become better acquainted with the Soundings, the quicksands, and the rocks, than if I had stayed upon the green shore, and piped a silly pipe, and took tea and comfortable advice. I was never afraid of failure; for I would sooner fail than not be among the greatest—But I am nigh getting into a rant. So, with remembrances to Taylor and Woodhouse etc. I am

Yours very sincerely
John Keats.





LXXIII.—TO GEORGE AND GEORGIANA KEATS.
[Hampstead, October 13 or 14, 1818.]

My dear George—There was a part in your Letter which gave me a great deal of pain, that where you lament not receiving Letters from England. I intended to have written immediately on my return from Scotland (which was two Months earlier than I had intended on account of my own as well as Tom’s health) but then I was told by Mrs. W. that you had said you would not wish any one to write till we had heard from you. This I thought odd and now I see that it could not have been so; yet at the time I suffered my unreflecting head to be satisfied, and went on in that sort of abstract careless and restless Life with which you are well acquainted. This sentence should it give you any uneasiness do not let it last for before I finish it will be explained away to your satisfaction—

I am grieved to say I am not sorry you had not Letters at Philadelphia; you could have had no good news of Tom and I have been withheld on his account from beginning these many days; I could not bring myself to say the truth, that he is no better but much worse—However it must be told; and you must my dear Brother and Sister take example from me and bear up against any Calamity for[Pg 169] my sake as I do for yours. Our’s are ties which independent of their own Sentiment are sent us by providence to prevent the deleterious effects of one great solitary grief. I have Fanny and I have you—three people whose Happiness to me is sacred—and it does annul that selfish sorrow which I should otherwise fall into, living as I do with poor Tom who looks upon me as his only comfort—the tears will come into your Eyes—let them—and embrace each other—thank heaven for what happiness you have, and after thinking a moment or two that you suffer in common with all Mankind hold it not a sin to regain your cheerfulness—

I will relieve you of one uneasiness of overleaf: I returned I said on account of my health—I am now well from a bad sore throat which came of bog trotting in the Island of Mull—of which you shall hear by the copies I shall make from my Scotch Letters—

Your content in each other is a delight to me which I cannot express—the Moon is now shining full and brilliant—she is the same to me in Matter, what you are to me in Spirit. If you were here my dear Sister I could not pronounce the words which I can write to you from a distance: I have a tenderness for you, and an admiration which I feel to be as great and more chaste than I can have for any woman in the world. You will mention Fanny—her character is not formed, her identity does not press upon me as yours does. I hope from the bottom of my heart that I may one day feel as much for her as I do for you—I know not how it is, but I have never made any acquaintance of my own—nearly all through your medium my dear Brother—through you I know not only a Sister but a glorious human being. And now I am talking of those to whom you have made me known I cannot forbear mentioning Haslam as a most kind and obliging and constant friend. His behaviour to Tom during my absence and since my return has endeared him to me for ever—besides his anxiety about you. To-morrow I shall call on your Mother and[Pg 170] exchange information with her. On Tom’s account I have not been able to pass so much time with her as I would otherwise have done—I have seen her but twice—once I dined with her and Charles—She was well, in good spirits, and I kept her laughing at my bad jokes. We went to tea at Mrs. Millar’s, and in going were particularly struck with the light and shade through the Gate way at the Horse Guards. I intend to write you such Volumes that it will be impossible for me to keep any order or method in what I write: that will come first which is uppermost in my Mind, not that which is uppermost in my heart—besides I should wish to give you a picture of our Lives here whenever by a touch I can do it; even as you must see by the last sentence our walk past Whitehall all in good health and spirits—this I am certain of, because I felt so much pleasure from the simple idea of your playing a game at Cricket. At Mrs. Millar’s I saw Henry quite well—there was Miss Keasle—and the good-natured Miss Waldegrave—Mrs. Millar began a long story and you know it is her Daughter’s way to help her on as though her tongue were ill of the gout. Mrs. M. certainly tells a story as though she had been taught her Alphabet in Crutched Friars. Dilke has been very unwell; I found him very ailing on my return—he was under Medical care for some time, and then went to the Sea Side whence he has returned well. Poor little Mrs. D. has had another gall-stone attack; she was well ere I returned—she is now at Brighton. Dilke was greatly pleased to hear from you, and will write a letter for me to enclose—He seems greatly desirous of hearing from you of the settlement itself—


[October 14 or 15.]

I came by ship from Inverness, and was nine days at Sea without being sick—a little Qualm now and then put me in mind of you—however as soon as you touch the shore all the horrors of Sickness are soon forgotten, as was the case with a Lady on board who could not[Pg 171] hold her head up all the way. We had not been in the Thames an hour before her tongue began to some tune; paying off as it was fit she should all old scores. I was the only Englishman on board. There was a downright Scotchman who hearing that there had been a bad crop of Potatoes in England had brought some triumphant specimens from Scotland—these he exhibited with national pride to all the Lightermen and Watermen from the Nore to the Bridge. I fed upon beef all the way; not being able to eat the thick Porridge which the Ladies managed to manage with large awkward horn spoons into the bargain. Severn has had a narrow escape of his Life from a Typhus fever: he is now gaining strength—Reynolds has returned from a six weeks’ enjoyment in Devonshire—he is well, and persuades me to publish my pot of Basil as an answer to the attacks made on me in Blackwood’s Magazine and the Quarterly Review. There have been two Letters in my defence in the Chronicle and one in the Examiner, copied from the Alfred Exeter Paper, and written by Reynolds. I do not know who wrote those in the Chronicle. This is a mere matter of the moment—I think I shall be among the English Poets after my death. Even as a Matter of present interest the attempt to crush me in the Quarterly has only brought me more into notice, and it is a common expression among book men “I wonder the Quarterly should cut its own throat.”

It does me not the least harm in Society to make me appear little and ridiculous: I know when a man is superior to me and give him all due respect—he will be the last to laugh at me and as for the rest I feel that I make an impression upon them which insures me personal respect while I am in sight whatever they may say when my back is turned. Poor Haydon’s eyes will not suffer him to proceed with his picture—he has been in the Country—I have seen him but once since my return. I hurry matters together here because I do not know when the Mail sails—I shall[Pg 172] enquire to-morrow, and then shall know whether to be particular or general in my letter—You shall have at least two sheets a day till it does sail whether it be three days or a fortnight—and then I will begin a fresh one for the next Month. The Miss Reynoldses are very kind to me, but they have lately displeased me much, and in this way—Now I am coming the Richardson. On my return the first day I called they were in a sort of taking or bustle about a Cousin of theirs who having fallen out with her Grandpapa in a serious manner was invited by Mrs. R. to take Asylum in her house. She is an east indian and ought to be her Grandfather’s Heir.[82] At the time I called Mrs. R. was in conference with her up stairs, and the young Ladies were warm in her praises down stairs, calling her genteel, interesting and a thousand other pretty things to which I gave no heed, not being partial to 9 days’ wonders—Now all is completely changed—they hate her, and from what I hear she is not without faults—of a real kind: but she has others which are more apt to make women of inferior charms hate her. She is not a Cleopatra, but she is at least a Charmian. She has a rich Eastern look; she has fine eyes and fine manners. When she comes into a room she makes an impression the same as the Beauty of a Leopardess. She is too fine and too conscious of herself to repulse any Man who may address her—from habit she thinks that nothing particular. I always find myself more at ease with such a woman; the picture before me always gives me a life and animation which I cannot possibly feel with anything inferior. I am at such times too much occupied in admiring to be awkward or in a tremble. I forget myself entirely because I live in her. You will by this time think I am in love with her; so before I go any further I will tell you I am not—she kept me awake one Night as a tune of Mozart’s might do. I speak of the thing as a pastime and an amusement, than which I can feel none deeper than a conversation with an imperial woman,[Pg 173] the very “yes” and “no” of whose Lips is to me a Banquet. I don’t cry to take the moon home with me in my Pocket nor do I fret to leave her behind me. I like her and her like because one has no sensations—what we both are is taken for granted. You will suppose I have by this had much talk with her—no such thing—there are the Miss Reynoldses on the look out—They think I don’t admire her because I did not stare at her.

They call her a flirt to me—What a want of knowledge! She walks across a room in such a manner that a Man is drawn towards her with a magnetic Power. This they call flirting! they do not know things. They do not know what a Woman is. I believe though she has faults—the same as Charmian and Cleopatra might have had. Yet she is a fine thing speaking in a worldly way: for there are two distinct tempers of mind in which we judge of things—the worldly, theatrical and pantomimical; and the unearthly, spiritual and ethereal—in the former Buonaparte, Lord Byron and this Charmian hold the first place in our Minds; in the latter, John Howard, Bishop Hooker rocking his child’s cradle and you my dear Sister are the conquering feelings. As a Man in the world I love the rich talk of a Charmian; as an eternal Being I love the thought of you. I should like her to ruin me, and I should like you to save me. Do not think, my dear Brother, from this that my Passions are headlong, or likely to be ever of any pain to you—

“I am free from Men of Pleasure’s cares,
By dint of feelings far more deep than theirs.”

This is Lord Byron, and is one of the finest things he has said. I have no town talk for you, as I have not been much among people—as for Politics they are in my opinion only sleepy because they will soon be too wide awake. Perhaps not—for the long and continued Peace of England itself has given us notions of personal safety which are likely to prevent the re-establishment of our national Honesty.[Pg 174] There is, of a truth, nothing manly or sterling in any part of the Government. There are many Madmen in the Country I have no doubt, who would like to be beheaded on tower Hill merely for the sake of éclat, there are many Men like Hunt who from a principle of taste would like to see things go on better, there are many like Sir F. Burdett who like to sit at the head of political dinners,—but there are none prepared to suffer in obscurity for their Country—The motives of our worst men are Interest and of our best Vanity. We have no Milton, no Algernon Sidney—Governors in these days lose the title of Man in exchange for that of Diplomat and Minister. We breathe in a sort of Officinal Atmosphere—All the departments of Government have strayed far from Simplicity which is the greatest of Strength there is as much difference in this respect between the present Government and Oliver Cromwell’s as there is between the 12 Tables of Rome and the volumes of Civil Law which were digested by Justinian. A Man now entitled Chancellor has the same honour paid to him whether he be a Hog or a Lord Bacon. No sensation is created by Greatness but by the number of Orders a Man has at his Button holes. Notwithstanding the part which the Liberals take in the Cause of Napoleon, I cannot but think he has done more harm to the life of Liberty than any one else could have done: not that the divine right Gentlemen have done or intend to do any good—no they have taken a Lesson of him, and will do all the further harm he would have done without any of the good. The worst thing he has done is, that he has taught them how to organise their monstrous armies. The Emperor Alexander it is said intends to divide his Empire as did Diocletian—creating two Czars besides himself, and continuing the supreme Monarch of the whole. Should he do this and they for a series of Years keep peaceable among themselves Russia may spread her conquest even to China—I think it a very likely thing that China itself may fall, Turkey certainly will. Meanwhile European north Russia will[Pg 175] hold its horns against the rest of Europe, intriguing constantly with France. Dilke, whom you know to be a Godwin perfectibility Man, pleases himself with the idea that America will be the country to take up the human intellect where England leaves off—I differ there with him greatly—A country like the United States, whose greatest Men are Franklins and Washingtons will never do that. They are great Men doubtless, but how are they to be compared to those our countrymen Milton and the two Sidneys? The one is a philosophical Quaker full of mean and thrifty maxims, the other sold the very Charger who had taken him through all his Battles. Those Americans are great, but they are not sublime Man—the humanity of the United States can never reach the sublime. Birkbeck’s mind is too much in the American style—you must endeavour to infuse a little Spirit of another sort into the settlement, always with great caution, for thereby you may do your descendants more good than you may imagine. If I had a prayer to make for any great good, next to Tom’s recovery, it should be that one of your Children should be the first American Poet. I have a great mind to make a prophecy, and they say prophecies work out their own fulfilment—

’Tis the witching time of night,
Orbed is the moon and bright,
And the Stars they glisten, glisten,
Seeming with bright eyes to listen.
For what listen they?
For a song and for a charm,
See they glisten in alarm
And the Moon is waxing warm
To hear what I shall say.
Moon keep wide thy golden ears
Hearken Stars and hearken Spheres
Hearken thou eternal Sky
I sing an infant’s Lullaby,
O pretty Lullaby!
Listen, Listen, listen, listen
Glisten, glisten, glisten, glisten
And hear my Lullaby!
[Pg 176]Though the Rushes that will make
Its cradle still are in the lake,
Though the linen that will be
Its swathe, is on the cotton tree,
Though the woollen that will keep
It warm, is on the silly sheep;
Listen Starlight, listen, listen
Glisten, Glisten, glisten, glisten
And hear my Lullaby!
Child! I see thee! Child, I’ve found thee
Midst of the quiet all around thee!
Child, I see thee! Child, I spy thee
And thy mother sweet is nigh thee!—
Child, I know thee! Child no more
But a Poet evermore
See, See the Lyre, The Lyre
In a flame of fire
Upon the little cradle’s top
Flaring, flaring, flaring
Past the eyesight’s bearing—
Awake it from its sleep,
And see if it can keep
Its eyes upon the blaze—
Amaze, Amaze!
It stares, it stares, it stares
It dares what no one dares
It lifts its little hand into the flame
Unharm’d, and on the strings
Paddles a little tune and sings
With dumb endeavour sweetly!
Bard art thou completely!
Little Child
O’ the western wild,
Bard art thou completely!—
Sweetly, with dumb endeavour—
A Poet now or never!
Little Child
O’ the western wild
A Poet now or never!


[October 16.]

This is Friday, I know not what day of the Month—I will enquire to-morrow, for it is fit you should know the time I am writing. I went to Town yesterday, and calling at Mrs. Millar’s was told that your Mother would not be found at home—I met Henry as I turned the corner—I had no leisure to return, so I left the letters[Pg 177] with him. He was looking very well. Poor Tom is no better to-night—I am afraid to ask him what Message I shall send from him. And here I could go on complaining of my Misery, but I will keep myself cheerful for your Sakes. With a great deal of trouble I have succeeded in getting Fanny to Hampstead. She has been several times. Mr. Lewis has been very kind to Tom all the summer, there has scarce a day passed but he has visited him, and not one day without bringing or sending some fruit of the nicest kind. He has been very assiduous in his enquiries after you—It would give the old Gentleman a great deal of pleasure if you would send him a Sheet enclosed in the next parcel to me, after you receive this—how long it will be first—Why did I not write to Philadelphia? Really I am sorry for that neglect. I wish to go on writing ad infinitum to you—I wish for interesting matter and a pen as swift as the wind—But the fact is I go so little into the Crowd now that I have nothing fresh and fresh every day to speculate upon except my own Whims and Theories. I have been but once to Haydon’s, once to Hunt’s, once to Rice’s, once to Hessey’s. I have not seen Taylor, I have not been to the Theatre. Now if I had been many times to all these and was still in the habit of going I could on my return at night have each day something new to tell you of without any stop—But now I have such a dearth that when I get to the end of this sentence and to the bottom of this page I must wait till I can find something interesting to you before I begin another. After all it is not much matter what it may be about, for the very words from such a distance penned by this hand will be grateful to you—even though I were to copy out the tale of Mother Hubbard or Little Red Riding Hood.


[Later.]

I have been over to Dilke’s this evening—there with Brown we have been talking of different and indifferent Matters—of Euclid, of Metaphysics, of the Bible, of [Pg 178]Shakspeare, of the horrid System and consequences of the fagging at great schools. I know not yet how large a parcel I can send—I mean by way of Letters—I hope there can be no objection to my dowling up a quire made into a small compass. That is the manner in which I shall write. I shall send you more than Letters—I mean a tale—which I must begin on account of the activity of my Mind; of its inability to remain at rest. It must be prose and not very exciting. I must do this because in the way I am at present situated I have too many interruptions to a train of feeling to be able to write Poetry. So I shall write this Tale, and if I think it worth while get a duplicate made before I send it off to you.


[October 21.]

This is a fresh beginning the 21st October. Charles and Henry were with us on Sunday, and they brought me your Letter to your Mother—we agreed to get a Packet off to you as soon as possible. I shall dine with your Mother to-morrow, when they have promised to have their Letters ready. I shall send as soon as possible without thinking of the little you may have from me in the first parcel, as I intend, as I said before, to begin another Letter of more regular information. Here I want to communicate so largely in a little time that I am puzzled where to direct my attention. Haslam has promised to let me know from Capper and Hazlewood. For want of something better I shall proceed to give you some extracts from my Scotch Letters—Yet now I think on it why not send you the letters themselves—I have three of them at present—I believe Haydon has two which I will get in time. I dined with your Mother and Henry at Mrs. Millar’s on Thursday, when they gave me their Letters. Charles’s I have not yet—he has promised to send it. The thought of sending my Scotch Letters has determined me to enclose a few more which I have received and which will give you the best cue to how I am going on, better than you could otherwise know. Your Mother[Pg 179] was well, and I was sorry I could not stop later. I called on Hunt yesterday—it has been always my fate to meet Ollier there—On Thursday I walked with Hazlitt as far as Covent Garden: he was going to play Racquets. I think Tom has been rather better these few last days—he has been less nervous. I expect Reynolds to-morrow.


[Later, about October 25.]

Since I wrote thus far I have met with that same Lady again, whom I saw at Hastings and whom I met when we were going to the English Opera. It was in a street which goes from Bedford Row to Lamb’s Conduit Street.—I passed her and turned back: she seemed glad of it—glad to see me, and not offended at my passing her before. We walked on towards Islington, where we called on a friend of hers who keeps a Boarding School. She has always been an enigma to me—she has been in a Room with you and Reynolds, and wishes we should be acquainted without any of our common acquaintance knowing it. As we went along, sometimes through shabby, sometimes through decent Streets, I had my guessing at work, not knowing what it would be, and prepared to meet any surprise. First it ended at this House at Islington: on parting from which I pressed to attend her home. She consented, and then again my thoughts were at work what it might lead to, though now they had received a sort of genteel hint from the Boarding School. Our Walk ended in 34 Gloucester Street, Queen Square—not exactly so, for we went upstairs into her sitting-room, a very tasty sort of place with Books, Pictures, a bronze Statue of Buonaparte, Music, æolian Harp, a Parrot, a Linnet, a Case of choice Liqueurs, etc. etc. She behaved in the kindest manner—made me take home a Grouse for Tom’s dinner. Asked for my address for the purpose of sending more game.... I expect to pass some pleasant hours with her now and then: in which I feel I shall be of service to her in matters of knowledge and taste: if I can I will.... She and your[Pg 180] George are the only women à peu près de mon age whom I would be content to know for their mind and friendship alone.—I shall in a short time write you as far as I know how I intend to pass my Life—I cannot think of those things now Tom is so unwell and weak. Notwithstanding your Happiness and your recommendation I hope I shall never marry. Though the most beautiful Creature were waiting for me at the end of a Journey or a Walk; though the Carpet were of Silk, the Curtains of the morning Clouds; the chairs and Sofa stuffed with Cygnet’s down; the food Manna, the Wine beyond Claret, the Window opening on Winander mere, I should not feel—or rather my Happiness would not be so fine, as my Solitude is sublime. Then instead of what I have described, there is a sublimity to welcome me home—The roaring of the wind is my wife and the Stars through the window pane are my Children. The mighty abstract Idea I have of Beauty in all things stifles the more divided and minute domestic happiness—an amiable wife and sweet Children I contemplate as a part of that Beauty, but I must have a thousand of those beautiful particles to fill up my heart. I feel more and more every day, as my imagination strengthens, that I do not live in this world alone but in a thousand worlds—No sooner am I alone than shapes of epic greatness are stationed around me, and serve my Spirit the office which is equivalent to a King’s bodyguard—then “Tragedy with sceptred pall comes sweeping by.” According to my state of mind I am with Achilles shouting in the Trenches, or with Theocritus in the Vales of Sicily. Or I throw my whole being into Troilus, and repeating those lines, “I wander like a lost Soul upon the stygian Banks staying for waftage,” I melt into the air with a voluptuousness so delicate that I am content to be alone. These things, combined with the opinion I have of the generality of women—who appear to me as children to whom I would rather give a sugar Plum than my time, form a barrier against Matrimony which I rejoice in.

[Pg 181]I have written this that you might see I have my share of the highest pleasures, and that though I may choose to pass my days alone I shall be no Solitary. You see there is nothing spleenical in all this. The only thing that can ever affect me personally for more than one short passing day, is any doubt about my powers for poetry—I seldom have any, and I look with hope to the nighing time when I shall have none. I am as happy as a Man can be—that is, in myself I should be happy if Tom was well, and I knew you were passing pleasant days. Then I should be most enviable—with the yearning Passion I have for the beautiful, connected and made one with the ambition of my intellect. Think of my Pleasure in Solitude in comparison of my commerce with the world—there I am a child—there they do not know me, not even my most intimate acquaintance—I give into their feelings as though I were refraining from irritating a little child. Some think me middling, others silly, others foolish—every one thinks he sees my weak side against my will, when in truth it is with my will—I am content to be thought all this because I have in my own breast so great a resource. This is one great reason why they like me so; because they can all show to advantage in a room and eclipse from a certain tact one who is reckoned to be a good Poet. I hope I am not here playing tricks ‘to make the angels weep’: I think not: for I have not the least contempt for my species, and though it may sound paradoxical, my greatest elevations of soul leave me every time more humbled—Enough of this—though in your Love for me you will not think it enough.


[Later, October 29 or 31.]

Haslam has been here this morning and has taken all the Letters except this sheet, which I shall send him by the Twopenny, as he will put the Parcel in the Boston post Bag by the advice of Capper and Hazlewood, who assure him of the safety and expedition that way—the Parcel will be forwarded to Warder and thence to you all the same.[Pg 182] There will not be a Philadelphia ship for these six weeks—by that time I shall have another Letter to you. Mind you I mark this Letter A. By the time you will receive this you will have I trust passed through the greatest of your fatigues. As it was with your Sea Sickness I shall not hear of them till they are past. Do not set to your occupation with too great an anxiety—take it calmly—and let your health be the prime consideration. I hope you will have a Son, and it is one of my first wishes to have him in my Arms—which I will do please God before he cuts one double tooth. Tom is rather more easy than he has been: but is still so nervous that I cannot speak to him of these Matters—indeed it is the care I have had to keep his Mind aloof from feelings too acute that has made this Letter so short a one—I did not like to write before him a Letter he knew was to reach your hands—I cannot even now ask him for any Message—his heart speaks to you. Be as happy as you can. Think of me, and for my sake be cheerful.

Believe me, my dear Brother and sister, Your anxious and affectionate Brother
John.

This day is my Birth day.

All our friends have been anxious in their enquiries, and all send their remembrances.





LXXIV.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Hampstead, Friday Morn [October 16, 1818].

My dear Fanny—You must not condemn me for not being punctual to Thursday, for I really did not know whether it would not affect poor Tom too much to see you. You know how it hurt him to part with you the last time. At all events you shall hear from me; and if Tom keeps pretty well to-morrow, I will see Mr. Abbey the next day, and endeavour to settle that you shall be with us on Tuesday or Wednesday. I have good news from George—He has landed safely with our Sister—they are both in good health—their prospects are [Pg 183]good—and they are by this time nighing to their journey’s end—you shall hear the particulars soon.

Your affectionate Brother
John.

Tom’s love to you.





LXXV.—TO FANNY KEATS.
[Hampstead, October 26, 1818.]

My dear Fanny—I called on Mr. Abbey in the beginning of last Week: when he seemed averse to letting you come again from having heard that you had been to other places besides Well Walk. I do not mean to say you did wrongly in speaking of it, for there should rightly be no objection to such things: but you know with what People we are obliged in the course of Childhood to associate, whose conduct forces us into duplicity and falsehood to them. To the worst of People we should be openhearted: but it is as well as things are to be prudent in making any communication to any one, that may throw an impediment in the way of any of the little pleasures you may have. I do not recommend duplicity but prudence with such people. Perhaps I am talking too deeply for you: if you do not now, you will understand what I mean in the course of a few years. I think poor Tom is a little Better: he sends his love to you. I shall call on Mr. Abbey to-morrow: when I hope to settle when to see you again. Mrs. Dilke has been for some time at Brighton—she is expected home in a day or two. She will be pleased I am sure with your present. I will try for permission for you to remain here all Night should Mrs. D. return in time.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





LXXVI.—TO RICHARD WOODHOUSE.
[Hampstead, October 27, 1818.]

My dear Woodhouse—Your letter gave me great satisfaction, more on account of its friendliness than any relish of that matter in it which is accounted so acceptable[Pg 184] to the “genus irritabile.” The best answer I can give you is in a clerklike manner to make some observations on two principal points which seem to point like indices into the midst of the whole pro and con about genius, and views, and achievements, and ambition, et cætera.—1st. As to the poetical Character itself (I mean that sort, of which, if I am anything, I am a member; that sort distinguished from the Wordsworthian, or egotistical Sublime; which is a thing per se, and stands alone,) it is not itself—it has no self—It is everything and nothing—It has no character—it enjoys light and shade; it lives in gusto, be it foul or fair, high or low, rich or poor, mean or elevated—It has as much delight in conceiving an Iago as an Imogen. What shocks the virtuous philosopher delights the chameleon poet. It does no harm from its relish of the dark side of things, any more than from its taste for the bright one, because they both end in speculation. A poet is the most unpoetical of anything in existence, because he has no Identity—he is continually in for and filling some other body. The Sun,—the Moon,—the Sea, and men and women, who are creatures of impulse, are poetical, and have about them an unchangeable attribute; the poet has none, no identity—he is certainly the most unpoetical of all God’s creatures.—If then he has no self, and if I am a poet, where is the wonder that I should say I would write no more? Might I not at that very instant have been cogitating on the Characters of Saturn and Ops?[83] It is a wretched thing to confess; but it is a very fact, that not one word I ever utter can be taken for granted as an opinion growing out of my identical Nature—how can it, when I have no Nature? When I am in a room with people, if I ever am free from speculating on creations of my own brain, then, not myself goes home[Pg 185] to myself, but the identity of every one in the room begins to press upon me, so that I am in a very little time annihilated—not only among men; it would be the same in a nursery of Children. I know not whether I make myself wholly understood: I hope enough so to let you see that no dependence is to be placed on what I said that day.

In the 2d place, I will speak of my views, and of the life I purpose to myself. I am ambitious of doing the world some good: if I should be spared, that may be the work of maturer years—in the interval I will assay to reach to as high a summit in poetry as the nerve bestowed upon me will suffer. The faint conceptions I have of poems to come bring the blood frequently into my forehead—All I hope is, that I may not lose all interest in human affairs—that the solitary Indifference I feel for applause, even from the finest spirits, will not blunt any acuteness of vision I may have. I do not think it will. I feel assured I should write from the mere yearning and fondness I have for the beautiful, even if my night’s labours should be burnt every Morning, and no eye ever shine upon them. But even now I am perhaps not speaking from myself, but from some Character in whose soul I now live.

I am sure however that this next sentence is from myself—I feel your anxiety, good opinion, and friendship, in the highest degree, and am

Yours most sincerely
John Keats.





LXXVII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
[Hampstead, November 5, 1818.]

My dear Fanny—I have seen Mr. Abbey three times about you, and have not been able to get his consent. He says that once more between this and the Holidays will be sufficient. What can I do? I should have been at Walthamstow several times, but I am not able to leave Tom for so long a time as that would take me.[Pg 186] Poor Tom has been rather better these 4 last days in consequence of obtaining a little rest a nights. Write to me as often as you can, and believe that I would do anything to give you any pleasure—we must as yet wait patiently.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





LXXVIII.—TO JAMES RICE.
Well Walk [Hampstead,] Novr. 24, [1818].

My dear Rice—Your amende Honorable I must call “un surcroît d’Amitié,” for I am not at all sensible of anything but that you were unfortunately engaged and I was unfortunately in a hurry. I completely understand your feeling in this mistake, and find in it that balance of comfort which remains after regretting your uneasiness. I have long made up my mind to take for granted the genuine-heartedness of my friends, notwithstanding any temporary ambiguousness in their behaviour or their tongues, nothing of which however I had the least scent of this morning. I say completely understand; for I am everlastingly getting my mind into such-like painful trammels—and am even at this moment suffering under them in the case of a friend of ours.—I will tell you two most unfortunate and parallel slips—it seems down-right pre-intention—A friend says to me, “Keats, I shall go and see Severn this week.”—“Ah! (says I) you want him to take your Portrait.”—And again, “Keats,” says a friend, “when will you come to town again?”—“I will,” says I, “let you have the MS. next week.” In both these cases I appeared to attribute an interested motive to each of my friends’ questions—the first made him flush, the second made him look angry:—and yet I am innocent in both cases; my mind leapt over every interval, to what I saw was per se a pleasant subject with him. You see I have no allowances to make—you see how far I am from supposing you could show me any neglect. I very much regret the long time I[Pg 187] have been obliged to exile from you: for I have one or two rather pleasant occasions to confer upon with you. What I have heard from George is favourable—I expect a letter from the Settlement itself.

Your sincere friend
John Keats.

I cannot give any good news of Tom.





LXXIX.—TO FANNY KEATS.
[Hampstead,] Tuesday Morn [December 1, 1818].

My dear Fanny—Poor Tom has been so bad that I have delayed your visit hither—as it would be so painful to you both. I cannot say he is any better this morning—he is in a very dangerous state—I have scarce any hopes of him. Keep up your spirits for me my dear Fanny—repose entirely in

Your affectionate Brother
John.





LXXX.—TO GEORGE AND GEORGIANA KEATS.
[Hampstead,[84] about Decr. 18, 1818.]

My dear Brother and Sister—You will have been prepared before this reaches you for the worst news you could have, nay, if Haslam’s letter arrives in proper time, I have a consolation in thinking that the first shock will be past before you receive this. The last days of poor Tom were of the most distressing nature; but his last moments were not so painful, and his very last was without a pang. I will not enter into any parsonic comments on death—yet the common observations of the[Pg 188] commonest people on death are as true as their proverbs. I have scarce a doubt of immortality of some nature or other—neither had Tom. My friends have been exceedingly kind to me every one of them—Brown detained me at his House. I suppose no one could have had their time made smoother than mine has been. During poor Tom’s illness I was not able to write and since his death the task of beginning has been a hindrance to me. Within this last Week I have been everywhere—and I will tell you as nearly as possible how all go on. With Dilke and Brown I am quite thick—with Brown indeed I am going to domesticate—that is, we shall keep house together. I shall have the front parlour and he the back one, by which I shall avoid the noise of Bentley’s Children—and be the better able to go on with my Studies—which have been greatly interrupted lately, so that I have not the shadow of an idea of a book in my head, and my pen seems to have grown too gouty for sense. How are you going on now? The goings on of the world makes me dizzy—There you are with Birkbeck—here I am with Brown—sometimes I fancy an immense separation, and sometimes as at present, a direct communication of Spirit with you. That will be one of the grandeurs of immortality—There will be no space, and consequently the only commerce between spirits will be by their intelligence of each other—when they will completely understand each other, while we in this world merely comprehend each other in different degrees—the higher the degree of good so higher is our Love and friendship. I have been so little used to writing lately that I am afraid you will not smoke my meaning so I will give an example—Suppose Brown or Haslam or any one whom I understand in the next degree to what I do you, were in America, they would be so much the farther from me in proportion as their identity was less impressed upon me. Now the reason why I do not feel at the present moment so far from you is that I remember your Ways and Manners and actions; I know your manner of thinking, your[Pg 189] manner of feeling: I know what shape your joy or your sorrow would take; I know the manner of your walking, standing, sauntering, sitting down, laughing, punning, and every action so truly that you seem near to me. You will remember me in the same manner—and the more when I tell you that I shall read a passage of Shakspeare every Sunday at ten o’Clock—you read one at the same time, and we shall be as near each other as blind bodies can be in the same room.

I saw your Mother the day before yesterday, and intend now frequently to pass half a day with her—she seem’d tolerably well. I called in Henrietta Street and so was speaking with your Mother about Miss Millar—we had a chat about Heiresses—she told me I think of 7 or eight dying Swains. Charles was not at home. I think I have heard a little more talk about Miss Keasle—all I know of her is she had a new sort of shoe on of bright leather like our Knapsacks. Miss Millar gave me one of her confounded pinches. N.B. did not like it. Mrs. Dilke went with me to see Fanny last week, and Haslam went with me last Sunday. She was well—she gets a little plumper and had a little Colour. On Sunday I brought from her a present of facescreens and a work-bag for Mrs. D.—they were really very pretty. From Walthamstow we walked to Bethnal green—where I felt so tired from my long walk that I was obliged to go to Bed at ten. Mr. and Mrs. Keasle were there. Haslam has been excessively kind, and his anxiety about you is great; I never meet him but we have some chat thereon. He is always doing me some good turn—he gave me this thin paper[85] for the purpose of writing to you. I have been passing an hour this morning with Mr. Lewis—he wants news of you very much. Haydon was here yesterday—he amused us much by speaking of young Hoppner who went with Captain Ross on a voyage of discovery to the Poles.[Pg 190] The Ship was sometimes entirely surrounded with vast mountains and crags of ice, and in a few Minutes not a particle was to be seen all round the Horizon. Once they met with so vast a Mass that they gave themselves over for lost; their last resource was in meeting it with the Bowsprit, which they did, and split it asunder and glided through it as it parted, for a great distance—one Mile and more. Their eyes were so fatigued with the eternal dazzle and whiteness that they lay down on their backs upon deck to relieve their sight on the blue sky. Hoppner describes his dreadful weariness at the continual day—the sun ever moving in a circle round above their heads—so pressing upon him that he could not rid himself of the sensation even in the dark Hold of the Ship. The Esquimaux are described as the most wretched of Beings—they float from their summer to their winter residences and back again like white Bears on the ice floats. They seem never to have washed, and so when their features move the red skin shows beneath the cracking peel of dirt. They had no notion of any inhabitants in the World but themselves. The sailors who had not seen a Star for some time, when they came again southwards on the hailing of the first revision of one, all ran upon deck with feelings of the most joyful nature. Haydon’s eyes will not suffer him to proceed with his Picture—his Physician tells him he must remain two months more, inactive. Hunt keeps on in his old way—I am completely tired of it all. He has lately publish’d a Pocket Book called the literary Pocket-Book—full of the most sickening stuff you can imagine. Reynolds is well; he has become an Edinburgh Reviewer. I have not heard from Bailey. Rice I have seen very little of lately—and I am very sorry for it. The Miss R’s. are all as usual. Archer above all people called on me one day—he wanted some information by my means, from Hunt and Haydon, concerning some Man they knew. I got him what he wanted, but know none of the whys and wherefores. Poor Kirkman left Wentworth Place[Pg 191] one evening about half-past eight and was stopped, beaten and robbed of his Watch in Pond Street. I saw him a few days since; he had not recovered from his bruises. I called on Hazlitt the day I went to Romney Street—I gave John Hunt extracts from your letters—he has taken no notice. I have seen Lamb lately—Brown and I were taken by Hunt to Novello’s—there we were devastated and excruciated with bad and repeated puns—Brown don’t want to go again. We went the other evening to see Brutus a new Tragedy by Howard Payne, an American—Kean was excellent—the play was very bad. It is the first time I have been since I went with you to the Lyceum.

Mrs. Brawne who took Brown’s house for the Summer, still resides in Hampstead. She is a very nice woman, and her daughter senior is I think beautiful and elegant, graceful, silly, fashionable and strange. We have a little tiff now and then—and she behaves a little better, or I must have sheered off.[86] I find by a sidelong report from your Mother that I am to be invited to Miss Millar’s birthday dance. Shall I dance with Miss Waldegrave? Eh! I shall be obliged to shirk a good many there. I shall be the only Dandy there—and indeed I merely comply with the invitation that the party may not be entirely destitute of a specimen of that race. I shall appear in a complete dress of purple, Hat and all—with a list of the beauties I have conquered embroidered round my Calves.


Thursday [December 24].

This morning is so very fine, I should have walked over to Walthamstow if I had thought of it yesterday. What are you doing this morning? Have you a clear hard frost as we have? How do you come[Pg 192] on with the gun? Have you shot a Buffalo? Have you met with any Pheasants? My Thoughts are very frequently in a foreign Country—I live more out of England than in it. The Mountains of Tartary are a favourite lounge, if I happen to miss the Alleghany ridge, or have no whim for Savoy. There must be great pleasure in pursuing game—pointing your gun—no, it won’t do—now, no—rabbit it—now bang—smoke and feathers—where is it? Shall you be able to get a good pointer or so? Have you seen Mr. Trimmer? He is an acquaintance of Peachey’s. Now I am not addressing myself to G. minor, and yet I am—for you are one. Have you some warm furs? By your next Letters I shall expect to hear exactly how you go on—smother nothing—let us have all; fair and foul, all plain. Will the little bairn have made his entrance before you have this? Kiss it for me, and when it can first know a cheese from a Caterpillar show it my picture twice a Week. You will be glad to hear that Gifford’s attack upon me has done me service—it has got my Book among several sets—Nor must I forget to mention once more what I suppose Haslam has told you, the present of a £25 note I had anonymously sent me. I have many things to tell you—the best way will be to make copies of my correspondence; and I must not forget the Sonnet I received with the Note. Last Week I received the following from Woodhouse whom you must recollect:—

“My dear Keats—I send enclosed a Letter, which when read take the trouble to return to me. The History of its reaching me is this. My Cousin, Miss Frogley of Hounslow, borrowed my copy of Endymion for a specified time. Before she had time to look into it, she and my friend Mr. Hy. Neville of Esher, who was house Surgeon to the late Princess Charlotte, insisted upon having it to read for a day or two, and undertook to make my Cousin’s peace with me on account of the extra delay. Neville told me that one of the Misses Porter (of romance Celebrity) had seen it on his table, dipped into it, and expressed a wish to read it. I desired he should keep it as long and lend it to as many as he pleased, provided it was not allowed to slumber on any one’s shelf. I learned subsequently from Miss Frogley that these Ladies had[Pg 193] requested of Mr. Neville, if he was acquainted with the Author, the Pleasure of an introduction. About a week back the enclosed was transmitted by Mr. Neville to my Cousin, as a species of Apology for keeping her so long without the Book, and she sent it to me, knowing that it would give me Pleasure—I forward it to you for somewhat the same reason, but principally because it gives me the opportunity of naming to you (which it would have been fruitless to do before) the opening there is for an introduction to a class of society from which you may possibly derive advantage, as well as qualification, if you think proper to avail yourself of it. In such a case I should be very happy to further your Wishes. But do just as you please. The whole is entirely entre nous.—

Yours, etc.,
R. W.”

Well—now this is Miss Porter’s Letter to Neville—

“Dear Sir—As my Mother is sending a Messenger to Esher, I cannot but make the same the bearer of my regrets for not having had the pleasure of seeing you the morning you called at the gate. I had given orders to be denied, I was so very unwell with my still adhesive cold; but had I known it was you I should have taken off the interdict for a few minutes, to say how very much I am delighted with Endymion. I had just finished the Poem and have done as you permitted, lent it to Miss Fitzgerald. I regret you are not personally acquainted with the Author, for I should have been happy to have acknowledged to him, through the advantage of your communication, the very rare delight my sister and myself have enjoyed from the first fruits of Genius. I hope the ill-natured Review will not have damaged” (or damped) “such true Parnassian fire—it ought not, for when Life is granted, etc.”

—and so she goes on. Now I feel more obliged than flattered by this—so obliged that I will not at present give you an extravaganza of a Lady Romancer. I will be introduced to them if it be merely for the pleasure of writing to you about it—I shall certainly see a new race of People. I shall more certainly have no time for them.

Hunt has asked me to meet Tom Moore some day—so you shall hear of him. The Night we went to Novello’s there was a complete set to of Mozart and punning. I was so completely tired of it that if I were to follow my own inclinations I should never meet any one of that set again, not even Hunt, who is certainly a pleasant fellow in the main when you are with him—but in reality he is vain, egotistical, and disgusting in matters of taste and[Pg 194] in morals. He understands many a beautiful thing; but then, instead of giving other minds credit for the same degree of perception as he himself professes—he begins an explanation in such a curious manner that our taste and self-love is offended continually. Hunt does one harm by making fine things petty, and beautiful things hateful. Through him I am indifferent to Mozart, I care not for white Busts—and many a glorious thing when associated with him becomes a nothing. This distorts one’s mind—makes one’s thoughts bizarre—perplexes one in the standard of Beauty. Martin is very much irritated against Blackwood for printing some Letters in his Magazine which were Martin’s property—he always found excuses for Blackwood till he himself was injured, and now he is enraged. I have been several times thinking whether or not I should send you the Examiners, as Birkbeck no doubt has all the good periodical Publications—I will save them at all events. I must not forget to mention how attentive and useful Mrs. Bentley has been—I am very sorry to leave her—but I must, and I hope she will not be much a loser by it. Bentley is very well—he has just brought me a clothes’-basket of Books. Brown has gone to town to-day to take his Nephews who are on a visit here to see the Lions. I am passing a Quiet day—which I have not done for a long while—and if I do continue so, I feel I must again begin with my poetry—for if I am not in action mind or Body I am in pain—and from that I suffer greatly by going into parties where from the rules of society and a natural pride I am obliged to smother my Spirit and look like an Idiot—because I feel my impulses given way to would too much amaze them. I live under an everlasting restraint—never relieved except when I am composing—so I will write away.

Friday [December 25].

I think you knew before you left England that my next subject would be “the fall of Hyperion.”[Pg 195] I went on a little with it last night, but it will take some time to get into the vein again. I will not give you any extracts because I wish the whole to make an impression. I have however a few Poems which you will like, and I will copy out on the next sheet. I shall dine with Haydon on Sunday, and go over to Walthamstow on Monday if the frost hold. I think also of going into Hampshire this Christmas to Mr. Snook’s[87]—they say I shall be very much amused—But I don’t know—I think I am in too huge a Mind for study—I must do it—I must wait at home and let those who wish come to see me. I cannot always be (how do you spell it?) trapsing. Here I must tell you that I have not been able to keep the journal or write the Tale I promised—now I shall be able to do so. I will write to Haslam this morning to know when the Packet sails, and till it does I will write something every day—After that my journal shall go on like clockwork, and you must not complain of its dulness—for what I wish is to write a quantity to you—knowing well that dulness itself will from me be interesting to you—You may conceive how this not having been done has weighed upon me. I shall be able to judge from your next what sort of information will be of most service or amusement to you. Perhaps as you were fond of giving me sketches of character you may like a little picnic of scandal even across the Atlantic. But now I must speak particularly to you, my dear Sister—for I know you love a little quizzing better than a great bit of apple dumpling. Do you know Uncle Redhall? He is a little Man with an innocent powdered upright head, he lisps with a protruded under lip—he has two Nieces, each one would weigh three of him—one for height and the other for breadth—he knew Bartolozzi. He gave a supper, and ranged his bottles of wine all up the Kitchen and cellar stairs—quite ignorant of what might be drunk—It might have been a good joke[Pg 196] to pour on the sly bottle after bottle into a washing tub, and roar for more—If you were to trip him up it would discompose a Pigtail and bring his under lip nearer to his nose. He never had the good luck to lose a silk Handkerchief in a Crowd, and therefore has only one topic of conversation—Bartolozzi. Shall I give you Miss Brawne? She is about my height—with a fine style of countenance of the lengthened sort—she wants sentiment in every feature—she manages to make her hair look well—her nostrils are fine—though a little painful—her mouth is bad and good—her Profile is better than her full-face which indeed is not full but pale and thin without showing any bone. Her shape is very graceful and so are her movements—her Arms are good her hands baddish—her feet tolerable. She is not seventeen—but she is ignorant—monstrous in her behaviour, flying out in all directions—calling people such names that I was forced lately to make use of the term Minx—this is I think not from any innate vice, but from a penchant she has for acting stylishly—I am however tired of such style and shall decline any more of it. She had a friend to visit her lately—you have known plenty such—her face is raw as if she was standing out in a frost; her lips raw and seem always ready for a Pullet—she plays the Music without one sensation but the feel of the ivory at her fingers. She is a downright Miss without one set off—We hated her and smoked her and baited her and I think drove her away. Miss B. thinks her a Paragon of fashion, and says she is the only woman she would change persons with. What a stupe—She is superior as a Rose to a Dandelion. When we went to bed Brown observed as he put out the Taper what a very ugly old woman that Miss Robinson would make—at which I must have groaned aloud for I’m sure ten minutes. I have not seen the thing Kingston again—George will describe him to you—I shall insinuate some of these Creatures into a Comedy some day—and perhaps have Hunt among them—

[Pg 197]Scene, a little Parlour. Enter Hunt—Gattie—Hazlitt—Mrs. Novello—Ollier. Gattie. Ha! Hunt, got into your new house? Ha! Mrs. Novello: seen Altam and his Wife?—Mrs. N. Yes (with a grin), it’s Mr. Hunt’s, isn’t it?—Gattie. Hunt’s? no, ha! Mr. Ollier, I congratulate you upon the highest compliment I ever heard paid to the Book. Mr. Hazlitt, I hope you are well.—Hazlitt. Yes Sir, no Sir.—Mr. Hunt (at the Music), “La Biondina,” etc. Hazlitt, did you ever hear this?—“La Biondina,” etc.—Hazlitt. O no Sir—I never.—Ollier. Do, Hunt, give it us over again—divine.—Gattie. Divino—Hunt, when does your Pocket-Book come out?—Hunt. “What is this absorbs me quite?” O we are spinning on a little, we shall floridise soon I hope. Such a thing was very much wanting—people think of nothing but money getting—now for me I am rather inclined to the liberal side of things. I am reckoned lax in my Christian principles, etc. etc. etc.


[December 29.]

It is some days since I wrote the last page—and what I have been about since I have no Idea. I dined at Haslam’s on Sunday—with Haydon yesterday, and saw Fanny in the morning; she was well. Just now I took out my poem to go on with it, but the thought of my writing so little to you came upon me and I could not get on—so I have began at random and I have not a word to say—and yet my thoughts are so full of you that I can do nothing else. I shall be confined at Hampstead a few days on account of a sore throat—the first thing I do will be to visit your Mother again. The last time I saw Henry he show’d me his first engraving, which I thought capital. Mr. Lewis called this morning and brought some American Papers—I have not look’d into them—I think we ought to have heard of you before this—I am in daily expectation of Letters—Nil desperandum. Mrs. Abbey wishes to take Fanny from School—I shall strive all I can against that. There has happened a great Misfortune in the Drewe Family—old[Pg 198] Drewe has been dead some time; and lately George Drewe expired in a fit—on which account Reynolds has gone into Devonshire. He dined a few days since at Horace Twisse’s with Liston and Charles Kemble. I see very little of him now, as I seldom go to Little Britain because the Ennui always seizes me there, and John Reynolds is very dull at home. Nor have I seen Rice. How you are now going on is a Mystery to me—I hope a few days will clear it up.


[December 30.]

I never know the day of the Month. It is very fine here to-day, though I expect a Thundercloud, or rather a snow cloud, in less than an hour. I am at present alone at Wentworth Place—Brown being at Chichester and Mr. and Mrs. Dilke making a little stay in Town. I know not what I should do without a sunshiny morning now and then—it clears up one’s spirits. Dilke and I frequently have some chat about you. I have now and then some doubt, but he seems to have a great confidence. I think there will soon be perceptible a change in the fashionable slang literature of the day—it seems to me that Reviews have had their day—that the public have been surfeited—there will soon be some new folly to keep the Parlours in talk—What it is I care not. We have seen three literary Kings in our Time—Scott, Byron, and then the Scotch novels. All now appears to be dead—or I may mistake, literary Bodies may still keep up the Bustle which I do not hear. Haydon show’d me a letter he had received from Tripoli—Ritchie was well and in good Spirits, among Camels, Turbans, Palm Trees, and Sands. You may remember I promised to send him an Endymion which I did not—however he has one—you have one. One is in the Wilds of America—the other is on a Camel’s back in the plains of Egypt. I am looking into a Book of Dubois’s—he has written directions to the Players—one of them is very good. “In singing never mind the music—observe what time you please. It[Pg 199] would be a pretty degradation indeed if you were obliged to confine your genius to the dull regularity of a fiddler—horse hair and cat’s guts—no, let him keep your time and play your tune—dodge him.” I will now copy out the Letter and Sonnet I have spoken of. The outside cover was thus directed, “Messrs. Taylor and Hessey, (Booksellers), No. 93 Fleet Street, London,” and it contained this:

‘Messrs. Taylor and Hessey are requested to forward the enclosed letter by some safe mode of conveyance to the Author of Endymion, who is not known at Teignmouth: or if they have not his address, they will return the letter by post, directed as below, within a fortnight, “Mr. P. Fenbank, P. O., Teignmouth.” 9th Novr. 1818.’

In this sheet was enclosed the following, with a superscription—‘Mr. John Keats, Teignmouth.’ Then came Sonnet to John Keats—which I would not copy for any in the world but you—who know that I scout “mild light and loveliness” or any such nonsense in myself.

Star of high promise!—not to this dark age
Do thy mild light and loveliness belong;
For it is blind, intolerant, and wrong;
Dead to empyreal soarings, and the rage
Of scoffing spirits bitter war doth wage
With all that bold integrity of song.
Yet thy clear beam shall shine through ages strong
To ripest times a light and heritage.
And there breathe now who dote upon thy fame,
Whom thy wild numbers wrap beyond their being,
Who love the freedom of thy lays—their aim
Above the scope of a dull tribe unseeing—
And there is one whose hand will never scant
From his poor store of fruits all thou canst want.

November 1818.  turn over.

I turn’d over and found a £25 note. Now this appears to me all very proper—if I had refused it I should have behaved in a very bragadochio dunderheaded manner—and yet the present galls me a little, and I do not know whether I shall not return it if I ever meet with the donor after, whom to no purpose I have written. I have[Pg 200] your Miniature on the Table George the great—it’s very like—though not quite about the upper lip. I wish we had a better of your little George. I must not forget to tell you that a few days since I went with Dilke a shooting on the heath and shot a Tomtit. There were as many guns abroad as Birds. I intended to have been at Chichester this Wednesday—but on account of this sore throat I wrote him (Brown) my excuse yesterday.


Thursday [December 31].

(I will date when I finish.)—I received a Note from Haslam yesterday—asking if my letter is ready—now this is only the second sheet—notwithstanding all my promises. But you must reflect what hindrances I have had. However on sealing this I shall have nothing to prevent my proceeding in a gradual journal, which will increase in a Month to a considerable size. I will insert any little pieces I may write—though I will not give any extracts from my large poem which is scarce began. I want to hear very much whether Poetry and literature in general has gained or lost interest with you—and what sort of writing is of the highest gust with you now. With what sensation do you read Fielding?—and do not Hogarth’s pictures seem an old thing to you? Yet you are very little more removed from general association than I am—recollect that no Man can live but in one society at a time—his enjoyment in the different states of human society must depend upon the Powers of his Mind—that is you can imagine a Roman triumph or an Olympic game as well as I can. We with our bodily eyes see but the fashion and Manners of one country for one age—and then we die. Now to me manners and customs long since passed whether among the Babylonians or the Bactrians are as real, or even more real than those among which I now live—My thoughts have turned lately this way—The more we know the more inadequacy we find in the world to satisfy us—this is an old observation; but I have made up my[Pg 201] Mind never to take anything for granted—but even to examine the truth of the commonest proverbs—This however is true. Mrs. Tighe and Beattie once delighted me—now I see through them and can find nothing in them but weakness, and yet how many they still delight! Perhaps a superior being may look upon Shakspeare in the same light—is it possible? No—This same inadequacy is discovered (forgive me, little George, you know I don’t mean to put you in the mess) in Women with few exceptions—the Dress Maker, the blue Stocking, and the most charming sentimentalist differ but in a slight degree and are equally smokeable. But I’ll go no further—I may be speaking sacrilegiously—and on my word I have thought so little that I have not one opinion upon anything except in matters of taste—I never can feel certain of any truth but from a clear perception of its Beauty—and I find myself very young minded even in that perceptive power—which I hope will increase. A year ago I could not understand in the slightest degree Raphael’s cartoons—now I begin to read them a little—And how did I learn to do so? By seeing something done in quite an opposite spirit—I mean a picture of Guido’s in which all the Saints, instead of that heroic simplicity and unaffected grandeur which they inherit from Raphael, had each of them both in countenance and gesture all the canting, solemn, melodramatic mawkishness of Mackenzie’s father Nicholas. When I was last at Haydon’s I looked over a Book of Prints taken from the fresco of the Church at Milan, the name of which I forget—in it are comprised Specimens of the first and second age of art in Italy. I do not think I ever had a greater treat out of Shakspeare. Full of Romance and the most tender feeling—magnificence of draperies beyond any I ever saw, not excepting Raphael’s. But Grotesque to a curious pitch—yet still making up a fine whole—even finer to me than more accomplish’d works—as there was left so much room for Imagination. I have not heard one of this last course of Hazlitt’s lectures. They[Pg 202] were upon ‘Wit and Humour,’ ‘the English comic writers.’


Saturday, Jany. 2nd [1819].

Yesterday Mr. and Mrs. D. and myself dined at Mrs. Brawne’s—nothing particular passed. I never intend hereafter to spend any time with Ladies unless they are handsome—you lose time to no purpose. For that reason I shall beg leave to decline going again to Redall’s or Butler’s or any Squad where a fine feature cannot be mustered among them all—and where all the evening’s amusement consists in saying ‘your good health, your good health, and your good health—and (O I beg your pardon) yours, Miss ——,’ and such thing not even dull enough to keep one awake—With respect to amiable speaking I can read—let my eyes be fed or I’ll never go out to dinner anywhere. Perhaps you may have heard of the dinner given to Thos. Moore in Dublin, because I have the account here by me in the Philadelphia democratic paper. The most pleasant thing that occurred was the speech Mr. Tom made on his Father’s health being drank. I am afraid a great part of my Letters are filled up with promises and what I will do rather than any great deal written—but here I say once for all—that circumstances prevented me from keeping my promise in my last, but now I affirm that as there will be nothing to hinder me I will keep a journal for you. That I have not yet done so you would forgive if you knew how many hours I have been repenting of my neglect. For I have no thought pervading me so constantly and frequently as that of you—my Poem cannot frequently drive it away—you will retard it much more than you could by taking up my time if you were in England. I never forget you except after seeing now and then some beautiful woman—but that is a fever—the thought of you both is a passion with me, but for the most part a calm one. I asked Dilke for a few lines for you—he has promised them—I shall send what I have written to Haslam on Monday Morning—what I can get into another sheet to-morrow I[Pg 203] will—There are one or two little poems you might like. I have given up snuff very nearly quite—Dilke has promised to sit with me this evening, I wish he would come this minute for I want a pinch of snuff very much just now—I have none though in my own snuff box. My sore throat is much better to-day—I think I might venture on a pinch. Here are the Poems—they will explain themselves—as all poems should do without any comment—

Ever let the Fancy roam,
Pleasure never is at home.
At a touch sweet pleasure melteth
Like to bubbles when rain pelteth:
Then let winged fancy wander
Towards heaven still spread beyond her—
Open wide the mind’s cage door,
She’ll dart forth and cloudward soar.
O sweet Fancy, let her loose!
Summer’s joys are spoilt by use,
And the enjoying of the spring
Fades as doth its blossoming:
Autumn’s red-lipped fruitage too
Blushing through the mist and dew,
Cloys with kissing. What do then?
Sit thee in an ingle when
The sear faggot blazes bright,
Spirit of a winter night:
When the soundless earth is muffled,
And the caked snow is shuffled
From the Ploughboy’s heavy shoon:
When the night doth meet the moon
In a dark conspiracy
To banish vesper from the sky.
Sit thee then and send abroad
With a Mind self-overaw’d
Fancy high-commission’d; send her,—
She’ll have vassals to attend her—
She will bring thee, spite of frost,
Beauties that the Earth has lost;
She will bring thee all together
All delights of summer weather;
All the faery buds of May,
On spring turf or scented spray;
All the heaped Autumn’s wealth
[Pg 204]With a still mysterious stealth;
She will mix these pleasures up
Like three fit wines in a cup
And thou shalt quaff it—Thou shalt hear
Instant harvest carols clear,
Bustle of the reaped corn
Sweet Birds antheming the Morn;
And in the same moment hark
To the early April lark,
And the rooks with busy caw
Foraging for sticks and straw.
Thou shalt at one glance behold
The daisy and the marigold;
White plumed lilies and the first
Hedgerow primrose that hath burst;
Shaded Hyacinth alway
Sapphire Queen of the Mid-may;
And every leaf and every flower
Pearled with the same soft shower.
Thou shalt see the fieldmouse creep
Meagre from its celled sleep,
And the snake all winter shrank
Cast its skin on sunny bank;
Freckled nest eggs shalt thou see
Hatching in the hawthorn tree;
When the hen-bird’s wing doth rest
Quiet on its mossy nest;
Then the hurry and alarm
When the Beehive casts its swarm—
Acorns ripe down scattering
While the autumn breezes sing,
For the same sleek throated mouse
To store up in its winter house.
O, sweet Fancy, let her loose!
Every joy is spoilt by use:
Every pleasure, every joy—
Not a Mistress but doth cloy.
Where’s the cheek that doth not fade,
Too much gaz’d at? Where’s the Maid
Whose lip mature is ever new?
Where’s the eye, however blue,
Doth not weary? Where’s the face
One would meet in every place?
Where’s the voice however soft
One would hear too oft and oft?
At a touch sweet pleasure melteth
Like to bubbles when rain pelteth.
[Pg 205]Let then winged fancy find
Thee a Mistress to thy mind.
Dulcet-eyed as Ceres’ daughter
Ere the God of torment taught her
How to frown and how to chide:
With a waist and with a side
White as Hebe’s when her Zone
Slipp’d its golden clasp, and down
Fell her Kirtle to her feet
While she held the goblet sweet,
And Jove grew languid—Mistress fair!
Thou shalt have that tressed hair
Adonis tangled all for spite;
And the mouth he would not kiss,
And the treasure he would miss;
And the hand he would not press
And the warmth he would distress.
O the Ravishment—the Bliss!
Fancy has her there she is—
Never fulsome, ever new,
There she steps! and tell me who
Has a Mistress so divine?
Be the palate ne’er so fine
She cannot sicken. Break the Mesh
Of the Fancy’s silken leash;
Where she’s tether’d to the heart.
Quickly break her prison string
And such joys as these she’ll bring,
Let the winged fancy roam,
Pleasure never is at home.

I did not think this had been so long a Poem. I have another not so long—but as it will more conveniently be copied on the other side I will just put down here some observations on Caleb Williams by Hazlitt—I meant to say St. Leon, for although he has mentioned all the Novels of Godwin very freely I do not quote them, but this only on account of its being a specimen of his usual abrupt manner, and fiery laconicism. He says of St. Leon—

“He is a limb torn off society. In possession of eternal youth and beauty he can feel no love; surrounded, tantalised, and tormented with riches, he can do no good. The faces of Men pass before him as in a speculum; but he is attached to them by no common tie of sympathy or suffering. He is thrown back into himself and his own thoughts. He lives in the solitude of his own[Pg 206] breast—without wife or child or friend or Enemy in the world. This is the solitude of the soul, not of woods or trees or mountains—but the desert of society—the waste and oblivion of the heart. He is himself alone. His existence is purely intellectual, and is therefore intolerable to one who has felt the rapture of affection, or the anguish of woe.”

As I am about it I might as well give you his character of Godwin as a Romancer:—

“Whoever else is, it is pretty clear that the author of Caleb Williams is not the author of Waverley. Nothing can be more distinct or excellent in their several ways than these two writers. If the one owes almost everything to external observations and traditional character, the other owes everything to internal conception and contemplation of the possible workings of the human Mind. There is little knowledge of the world, little variety, neither an eye for the picturesque nor a talent for the humorous in Caleb Williams, for instance, but you cannot doubt for a moment of the originality of the work and the force of the conception. The impression made upon the reader is the exact measure of the strength of the author’s genius. For the effect both in Caleb Williams and St. Leon is entirely made out, not by facts nor dates, by blackletter, or magazine learning, by transcript nor record, but by intense and patient study of the human heart, and by an imagination projecting itself into certain situations, and capable of working up its imaginary feelings to the height of reality.”

This appears to me quite correct—Now I will copy the other Poem—it is on the double immortality of Poets—

Bards of Passion and of Mirth
Ye have left your souls on earth—
Have ye souls in heaven too,
Double liv’d in regions new?
Yes—and those of heaven commune
With the spheres of Sun and Moon;
With the noise of fountains wondrous
And the parle of voices thund’rous;
With the Whisper of heaven’s trees,
And one another, in soft ease
Seated on elysian Lawns
Browsed by none but Dian’s fawns;
Underneath large bluebells tented,
Where the daisies are rose scented,
And the rose herself has got
[Pg 207]Perfume that on Earth is not.
Where the nightingale doth sing
Not a senseless, tranced thing;
But melodious truth divine,
Philosophic numbers fine;
Tales and golden histories
Of Heaven and its Mysteries.
Thus ye live on Earth, and then
On the Earth ye live again;
And the souls ye left behind you
Teach us here the way to find you,
Where your other souls are joying
Never slumber’d, never cloying.
Here your earth born souls still speak
To mortals of the little week
They must sojourn with their cares;
Of their sorrows and delights
Of their Passions and their spites;
Of their glory and their shame—
What doth strengthen and what maim.
Thus ye teach us every day
Wisdom though fled far away.
Bards of Passion and of Mirth,
Ye have left your Souls on Earth!
Ye have souls in heaven too,
Double liv’d in Regions new!

These are specimens of a sort of rondeau which I think I shall become partial to—because you have one idea amplified with greater ease and more delight and freedom than in the sonnet. It is my intention to wait a few years before I publish any minor poems—and then I hope to have a volume of some worth—and which those people will relish who cannot bear the burthen of a long poem. In my journal I intend to copy the poems I write the days they are written—There is just room, I see, in this page to copy a little thing I wrote off to some Music as it was playing—

I had a dove and the sweet dove died,
And I have thought it died of grieving:
O what could it mourn for? it was tied
With a silken thread of my own hand’s weaving.
Sweet little red-feet why did you die?
Why would you leave me—sweet dove why?
[Pg 208]You lived alone on the forest tree.
Why pretty thing could you not live with me?
I kissed you oft and I gave you white peas.
Why not live sweetly as in the green trees?


Sunday [January 3].

I have been dining with Dilke to-day—He is up to his Ears in Walpole’s letters. Mr. Manker is there, and I have come round to see if I can conjure up anything for you. Kirkman came down to see me this morning—his family has been very badly off lately. He told me of a villainous trick of his Uncle William in Newgate Street, who became sole Creditor to his father under pretence of serving him, and put an execution on his own Sister’s goods. He went in to the family at Portsmouth; conversed with them, went out and sent in the Sherriff’s officer. He tells me too of abominable behaviour of Archer to Caroline Mathew—Archer has lived nearly at the Mathews these two years; he has been amusing Caroline—and now he has written a Letter to Mrs. M. declining, on pretence of inability to support a wife as he would wish, all thoughts of marriage. What is the worst is Caroline is 27 years old. It is an abominable matter. He has called upon me twice lately—I was out both times. What can it be for?—There is a letter to-day in the Examiner to the Electors of Westminster on Mr. Hobhouse’s account. In it there is a good character of Cobbett—I have not the paper by me or I would copy it. I do not think I have mentioned the discovery of an African Kingdom—the account is much the same as the first accounts of Mexico—all magnificence—There is a Book being written about it. I will read it and give you the cream in my next. The romance we have heard upon it runs thus: They have window frames of gold—100,000 infantry—human sacrifices. The Gentleman who is the Adventurer has his wife with him—she, I am told, is a beautiful little sylphid woman—her husband was to have been sacrificed to their Gods and was led through a Chamber filled with different instruments of torture with privilege to choose what[Pg 209] death he would die, without their having a thought of his aversion to such a death, they considering it a supreme distinction. However he was let off, and became a favourite with the King, who at last openly patronised him, though at first on account of the Jealousy of his Ministers he was wont to hold conversations with his Majesty in the dark middle of the night. All this sounds a little Bluebeardish—but I hope it is true. There is another thing I must mention of the momentous kind;—but I must mind my periods in it—Mrs. Dilke has two Cats—a Mother and a Daughter—now the Mother is a tabby and the daughter a black and white like the spotted child. Now it appears to me, for the doors of both houses are opened frequently, so that there is a complete thoroughfare for both Cats (there being no board up to the contrary), they may one and several of them come into my room ad libitum. But no—the Tabby only comes—whether from sympathy for Ann the Maid or me I cannot tell—or whether Brown has left behind him any atmospheric spirit of Maidenhood I cannot tell. The Cat is not an old Maid herself—her daughter is a proof of it—I have questioned her—I have look’d at the lines of her paw—I have felt her pulse—to no purpose. Why should the old Cat come to me? I ask myself—and myself has not a word to answer. It may come to light some day; if it does you shall hear of it.

Kirkman this morning promised to write a few lines to you and send them to Haslam. I do not think I have anything to say in the Business way. You will let me know what you would wish done with your property in England—what things you would wish sent out—But I am quite in the dark about what you are doing—If I do not hear soon I shall put on my wings and be after you. I will in my next, and after I have seen your next letter, tell you my own particular idea of America. Your next letter will be the key by which I shall open your hearts and see what spaces want filling with any particular information—Whether the affairs of Europe are more or[Pg 210] less interesting to you—whether you would like to hear of the Theatres—of the bear Garden—of the Boxers—the Painters, the Lectures—the Dress—The progress of Dandyism—The Progress of Courtship—or the fate of Mary Millar—being a full, true, and très particular account of Miss M.’s ten Suitors—How the first tried the effect of swearing; the second of stammering; the third of whispering;—the fourth of sonnets—the fifth of Spanish leather boots;—the sixth of flattering her body—the seventh of flattering her mind—the eighth of flattering himself—the ninth stuck to the Mother—the tenth kissed the Chambermaid and told her to tell her Mistress—But he was soon discharged, his reading led him into an error; he could not sport the Sir Lucius to any advantage. And now for this time I bid you good-bye—I have been thinking of these sheets so long that I appear in closing them to take my leave of you—but that is not it—I shall immediately as I send this off begin my journal—when some days I shall write no more than 10 lines and others 10 times as much. Mrs. Dilke is knocking at the wall for Tea is ready—I will tell you what sort of a tea it is and then bid you Good-bye.


[January 4.]

This is Monday morning—nothing particular happened yesterday evening, except that when the tray came up Mrs. Dilke and I had a battle with celery stalks—she sends her love to you. I shall close this and send it immediately to Haslam—remaining ever, My dearest brother and sister,

Your most affectionate Brother
John.





LXXXI.—TO RICHARD WOODHOUSE.
Wentworth Place, Friday Morn [December 18, 1818].

My dear Woodhouse—I am greatly obliged to you. I must needs feel flattered by making an impression on a set of ladies. I should be content to do so by meretricious romance verse, if they alone, and not men, were[Pg 211] to judge. I should like very much to know those ladies—though look here, Woodhouse—I have a new leaf to turn over: I must work; I must read; I must write. I am unable to afford time for new acquaintances. I am scarcely able to do my duty to those I have. Leave the matter to chance. But do not forget to give my remembrances to your cousin.

Yours most sincerely
John Keats.





LXXXII.—TO MRS. REYNOLDS.
Wentworth Place, Tuesd. [December 22, 1818].

My dear Mrs. Reynolds—When I left you yesterday, ’twas with the conviction that you thought I had received no previous invitation for Christmas day: the truth is I had, and had accepted it under the conviction that I should be in Hampshire at the time: else believe me I should not have done so, but kept in Mind my old friends. I will not speak of the proportion of pleasure I may receive at different Houses—that never enters my head—you may take for a truth that I would have given up even what I did see to be a greater pleasure, for the sake of old acquaintanceship—time is nothing—two years are as long as twenty.

Yours faithfully
John Keats.





LXXXIII.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
Wentworth Place, Tuesday [December 22, 1818].

My dear Haydon—Upon my Soul I never felt your going out of the room at all—and believe me I never rhodomontade anywhere but in your Company—my general Life in Society is silence. I feel in myself all the vices of a Poet, irritability, love of effect and admiration—and influenced by such devils I may at times say more ridiculous things than I am aware of—but I will put a stop to that in a manner I have long resolved upon—I will buy a gold ring and put it on my finger—and[Pg 212] from that time a Man of superior head shall never have occasion to pity me, or one of inferior Nunskull to chuckle at me. I am certainly more for greatness in a shade than in the open day—I am speaking as a mortal—I should say I value more the privilege of seeing great things in loneliness than the fame of a Prophet. Yet here I am sinning—so I will turn to a thing I have thought on more—I mean your means till your picture be finished: not only now but for this year and half have I thought of it. Believe me Haydon I have that sort of fire in my heart that would sacrifice everything I have to your service—I speak without any reserve—I know you would do so for me—I open my heart to you in a few words. I will do this sooner than you shall be distressed: but let me be the last stay—Ask the rich lovers of Art first—I’ll tell you why—I have a little money which may enable me to study, and to travel for three or four years. I never expect to get anything by my Books: and moreover I wish to avoid publishing—I admire Human Nature but I do not like Men. I should like to compose things honourable to Man—but not fingerable over by Men. So I am anxious to exist without troubling the printer’s devil or drawing upon Men’s or Women’s admiration—in which great solitude I hope God will give me strength to rejoice. Try the long purses—but do not sell your drawings or I shall consider it a breach of friendship. I am sorry I was not at home when Salmon called. Do write and let me know all your present whys and wherefores.

Yours most faithfully
John Keats.





LXXXIV.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
Wentworth Place, [December 24, 1818].

My dear Taylor—Can you lend me £30 for a short time? Ten I want for myself—and twenty for a friend—which will be repaid me by the middle of next month. I shall go to Chichester on Wednesday and perhaps stay[Pg 213] a fortnight—I am afraid I shall not be able to dine with you before I return. Remember me to Woodhouse.

Yours sincerely
John Keats.





LXXXV.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
Wentworth Place, [December 27, 1818].

My dear Haydon—I had an engagement to-day—and it is so fine a morning that I cannot put it off—I will be with you to-morrow—when we will thank the Gods, though you have bad eyes and I am idle.

I regret more than anything the not being able to dine with you to-day. I have had several movements that way—but then I should disappoint one who has been my true friend. I will be with you to-morrow morning and stop all day—we will hate the profane vulgar and make us Wings.

God bless you.
J. Keats.





LXXXVI.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, Wednesday [December 30, 1818].

My dear Fanny—I am confined at Hampstead with a sore throat; but I do not expect it will keep me above two or three days. I intended to have been in Town yesterday but feel obliged to be careful a little while. I am in general so careless of these trifles, that they tease me for Months, when a few days’ care is all that is necessary. I shall not neglect any chance of an endeavour to let you return to School—nor to procure you a Visit to Mrs. Dilke’s which I have great fears about. Write me if you can find time—and also get a few lines ready for George as the Post sails next Wednesday.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





[Pg 214]

LXXXVII.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
Wentworth Place, Monday Aft. [January 4, 1819].

My dear Haydon—I have been out this morning, and did not therefore see your note till this minute, or I would have gone to town directly—it is now too late for to-day. I will be in town early to-morrow, and trust I shall be able to lend you assistance noon or night. I was struck with the improvement in the architectural part of your Picture—and, now I think on it, I cannot help wondering you should have had it so poor, especially after the Solomon. Excuse this dry bones of a note: for though my pen may grow cold, I should be sorry my Life should freeze—

Your affectionate friend
John Keats.





LXXXVIII.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
Wentworth Place, [between January 7 and 14, 1819].

My dear Haydon—We are very unlucky—I should have stopped to dine with you, but I knew I should not have been able to leave you in time for my plaguy sore throat; which is getting well.

I shall have a little trouble in procuring the Money and a great ordeal to go through—no trouble indeed to any one else—or ordeal either. I mean I shall have to go to town some thrice, and stand in the Bank an hour or two—to me worse than anything in Dante—I should have less chance with the people around me than Orpheus had with the Stones. I have been writing a little now and then lately: but nothing to speak of—being discontented and as it were moulting. Yet I do not think I shall ever come to the rope or the Pistol, for after a day or two’s melancholy, although I smoke more and more my own insufficiency—I see by little and little more of what is to be done, and how it is to be done, should I ever be able to do it. On my soul, there should be some[Pg 215] reward for that continual agonie ennuyeuse. I was thinking of going into Hampshire for a few days. I have been delaying it longer than I intended. You shall see me soon; and do not be at all anxious, for this time I really will do, what I never did before in my life, business in good time, and properly.—With respect to the Bond—it may be a satisfaction to you to let me have it: but as you love me do not let there be any mention of interest, although we are mortal men—and bind ourselves for fear of death.

Yours for ever
John Keats.





LXXXIX.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
Wentworth Place, [January 1819].

My dear Haydon—My throat has not suffered me yet to expose myself to the night air: however I have been to town in the day time—have had several interviews with my guardian—have written him rather a plain-spoken Letter—which has had its effect; and he now seems inclined to put no stumbling-block in my way: so that I see a good prospect of performing my promise. What I should have lent you ere this if I could have got it, was belonging to poor Tom—and the difficulty is whether I am to inherit it before my Sister is of age; a period of six years. Should it be so I must incontinently take to Corduroy Trousers. But I am nearly confident ’tis all a Bam. I shall see you soon—but do let me have a line to-day or to-morrow concerning your health and spirits.

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





XC.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, [January 1819].

My dear Fanny—I send this to Walthamstow for fear you should not be at Pancras Lane when I call to-morrow—before going into Hampshire for a few days—I[Pg 216] will not be more I assure you—You may think how disappointed I am in not being able to see you more and spend more time with you than I do—but how can it be helped? The thought is a continual vexation to me—and often hinders me from reading and composing—Write to me as often as you can—and believe me,

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





XCI.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, Feby. [11, 1819]. Thursday.

My dear Fanny—Your Letter to me at Bedhampton hurt me very much,—What objection can there be to your receiving a Letter from me? At Bedhampton I was unwell and did not go out of the Garden Gate but twice or thrice during the fortnight I was there—Since I came back I have been taking care of myself—I have been obliged to do so, and am now in hopes that by this care I shall get rid of a sore throat which has haunted me at intervals nearly a twelvemonth. I had always a presentiment of not being able to succeed in persuading Mr. Abbey to let you remain longer at School—I am very sorry that he will not consent. I recommend you to keep up all that you know and to learn more by yourself however little. The time will come when you will be more pleased with Life—look forward to that time and, though it may appear a trifle be careful not to let the idle and retired Life you lead fix any awkward habit or behaviour on you—whether you sit or walk endeavour to let it be in a seemly and if possible a graceful manner. We have been very little together: but you have not the less been with me in thought. You have no one in the world besides me who would sacrifice anything for you—I feel myself the only Protector you have. In all your little troubles think of me with the thought that there is at least one person in England who if he could would help you out of them—I live in hopes of being able to make you happy.—I should not perhaps write in[Pg 217] this manner, if it were not for the fear of not being able to see you often or long together. I am in hopes Mr. Abbey will not object any more to your receiving a letter now and then from me. How unreasonable! I want a few more lines from you for George—there are some young Men, acquaintances of a Schoolfellow of mine, going out to Birkbeck’s at the latter end of this Month—I am in expectation every day of hearing from George—I begin to fear his last letters miscarried. I shall be in town to-morrow—if you should not be in town, I shall send this little parcel by the Walthamstow Coach—I think you will like Goldsmith—Write me soon—

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.

Mrs. Dilke has not been very well—she is gone a walk to town to-day for exercise.





XCII.—TO GEORGE AND GEORGIANA KEATS.
Sunday Morng. February 14, [1819].

My dear Brother and Sister—How is it that we have not heard from you from the Settlement yet? The letters must surely have miscarried. I am in expectation every day. Peachey wrote me a few days ago, saying some more acquaintances of his were preparing to set out for Birkbeck; therefore, I shall take the opportunity of sending you what I can muster in a sheet or two. I am still at Wentworth Place—indeed, I have kept indoors lately, resolved if possible to rid myself of my sore throat; consequently I have not been to see your Mother since my return from Chichester; but my absence from her has been a great weight upon me. I say since my return from Chichester—I believe I told you I was going thither. I was nearly a fortnight at Mr. John Snook’s and a few days at old Mr. Dilke’s. Nothing worth speaking of happened at either place. I took down some thin paper and wrote on it a little poem called St. Agnes’s Eve, which you shall have as it is when I have[Pg 218] finished the blank part of the rest for you. I went out twice at Chichester to dowager Card parties. I see very little now, and very few persons, being almost tired of men and things. Brown and Dilke are very kind and considerate towards me. The Miss R.’s have been stopping next door lately, but are very dull. Miss Brawne and I have every now and then a chat and a tiff. Brown and Dilke are walking round their garden, hands in pockets, making observations. The literary world I know nothing about. There is a poem from Rogers dead born; and another satire is expected from Byron, called “Don Giovanni.” Yesterday I went to town for the first time for these three weeks. I met people from all parts and of all sets—Mr. Towers, one of the Holts, Mr. Dominie Williams, Mr. Woodhouse, Mrs. Hazlitt and son, Mrs. Webb, and Mrs. Septimus Brown. Mr. Woodhouse was looking up at a book window in Newgate Street, and, being short-sighted, twisted his muscles into so queer a stage that I stood by in doubt whether it was him or his brother, if he has one, and turning round, saw Mrs. Hazlitt, with that little Nero, her son. Woodhouse, on his features subsiding, proved to be Woodhouse, and not his brother. I have had a little business with Mr. Abbey from time to time; he has behaved to me with a little Brusquerie: this hurt me a little, especially when I knew him to be the only man in England who dared to say a thing to me I did not approve of without its being resented, or at least noticed—so I wrote him about it, and have made an alteration in my favour—I expect from this to see more of Fanny, who has been quite shut out from me. I see Cobbett has been attacking the Settlement, but I cannot tell what to believe, and shall be all out at elbows till I hear from you. I am invited to Miss Millar’s birthday dance on the 19th—I am nearly sure I shall not be able to go. A dance would injure my throat very much. I see very little of Reynolds. Hunt, I hear, is going on very badly—I mean in money[Pg 219] matters. I shall not be surprised to hear of the worst. Haydon too, in consequence of his eyes, is out at elbows. I live as prudently as it is possible for me to do. I have not seen Haslam lately. I have not seen Richards for this half year, Rice for three months, or Charles Cowden Clarke for God knows when.

When I last called in Henrietta Street[88] Miss Millar was very unwell, and Miss Waldegrave as staid and self-possessed as usual. Henry was well. There are two new tragedies—one by the apostate Maw, and one by Miss Jane Porter. Next week I am going to stop at Taylor’s for a few days, when I will see them both and tell you what they are. Mr. and Mrs. Bentley are well, and all the young carrots. I said nothing of consequence passed at Snook’s—no more than this—that I like the family very much. Mr. and Mrs. Snook were very kind We used to have a little religion and politics together almost every evening,—and sometimes about you. He proposed writing out for me his experience in farming, for me to send to you. If I should have an opportunity of talking to him about it, I will get all I can at all events; but you may say in your answer to this what value you place upon such information. I have not seen Mr. Lewis lately, for I have shrank from going up the hill. Mr. Lewis went a few mornings ago to town with Mrs. Brawne. They talked about me, and I heard that Mr. L. said a thing I am not at all contented with. Says he, “O, he is quite the little poet.” Now this is abominable—You might as well say Buonaparte is quite the little soldier. You see what it is to be under six foot and not a lord. There is a long fuzz to-day in the Examiner about a young man who delighted a young woman with a valentine—I think it must be Ollier’s. Brown and I are thinking of passing the summer at Brussels—If we do, we shall go about the first of May. We—i.e. Brown and I—sit opposite one another all day authorizing (N.B., an “s” instead of a “z” would[Pg 220] give a different meaning). He is at present writing a story of an old woman who lived in a forest, and to whom the Devil or one of his aides-de-feu came one night very late and in disguise. The old dame sets before him pudding after pudding—mess after mess—which he devours, and moreover casts his eyes up at a side of Bacon hanging over his head, and at the same time asks if her Cat is a Rabbit. On going he leaves her three pips of Eve’s Apple, and somehow she, having lived a virgin all her life, begins to repent of it, and wished herself beautiful enough to make all the world and even the other world fall in love with her. So it happens, she sets out from her smoky cottage in magnificent apparel.—The first City she enters, every one falls in love with her, from the Prince to the Blacksmith. A young gentleman on his way to the Church to be married leaves his unfortunate Bride and follows this nonsuch—A whole regiment of soldiers are smitten at once and follow her—A whole convent of Monks in Corpus Christi procession join the soldiers.—The mayor and corporation follow the same road—Old and young, deaf and dumb,—all but the blind,—are smitten, and form an immense concourse of people, who——what Brown will do with them I know not. The devil himself falls in love with her, flies away with her to a desert place, in consequence of which she lays an infinite number of eggs—the eggs being hatched from time to time, fill the world with many nuisances, such as John Knox, George Fox, Johanna Southcote, and Gifford.

There have been within a fortnight eight failures of the highest consequence in London. Brown went a few evenings since to Davenport’s, and on his coming in he talked about bad news in the city with such a face I began to think of a national bankruptcy. I did not feel much surprised and was rather disappointed. Carlisle, a bookseller on the Hone principle, has been issuing pamphlets from his shop in Fleet Street called the Deist. He was conveyed to Newgate last Thursday;[Pg 221] he intends making his own defence. I was surprised to hear from Taylor the amount of money of the bookseller’s last sale. What think you of £25,000? He sold 4000 copies of Lord Byron. I am sitting opposite the Shakspeare I brought from the Isle of Wight—and I never look at him but the silk tassels on it give me as much pleasure as the face of the poet itself.[89]

In my next packet, as this is one by the way, I shall send you the Pot of Basil, St. Agnes Eve, and if I should have finished it, a little thing called the Eve of St. Mark. You see what fine Mother Radcliff names I have—it is not my fault—I do not search for them. I have not gone on with Hyperion—for to tell the truth I have not been in great cue for writing lately—I must wait for the spring to rouse me up a little. The only time I went out from Bedhampton was to see a chapel consecrated—Brown, I, and John Snook the boy, went in a chaise behind a leaden horse. Brown drove, but the horse did not mind him. This chapel is built by a Mr. Way, a great Jew converter, who in that line has spent one hundred thousand pounds. He maintains a great number of poor Jews—Of course his communion plate was stolen. He spoke to the clerk about it—The clerk said he was very sorry, adding, “I dare shay, your honour, it’s among ush.”

The chapel is built in Mr. Way’s park. The consecration was not amusing. There were numbers of carriages—and his house crammed with clergy—They sanctified the Chapel, and it being a wet day, consecrated the burial-ground through the vestry window. I begin to hate parsons; they did not make me love them that day when I saw them in their proper colours. A parson is a Lamb in a drawing-room, and a Lion in a vestry. The notions of Society will not permit a parson to give way to his temper in any shape—So he festers in himself—his features get a peculiar, diabolical, self-sufficient, iron stupid expression. He is continually acting—his[Pg 222] mind is against every man, and every man’s mind is against him—He is a hypocrite to the Believer and a coward to the unbeliever—He must be either a knave or an idiot—and there is no man so much to be pitied as an idiot parson. The soldier who is cheated into an Esprit du Corps by a red coat, a band, and colours, for the purpose of nothing, is not half so pitiable as the parson who is led by the nose by the Bench of Bishops and is smothered in absurdities—a poor necessary subaltern of the Church.


Friday, Feby. 18.

The day before yesterday I went to Romney Street—your Mother was not at home—but I have just written her that I shall see her on Wednesday. I call’d on Mr. Lewis this morning—he is very well—and tells me not to be uneasy about Letters, the chances being so arbitrary. He is going on as usual among his favourite democrat papers. We had a chat as usual about Cobbett and the Westminster electors. Dilke has lately been very much harrassed about the manner of educating his son—he at length decided for a public school—and then he did not know what school—he at last has decided for Westminster; and as Charley is to be a day boy, Dilke will remove to Westminster. We lead very quiet lives here—Dilke is at present in Greek histories and antiquities, and talks of nothing but the electors of Westminster and the retreat of the ten-thousand. I never drink now above three glasses of wine—and never any spirits and water. Though by the bye, the other day Woodhouse took me to his coffee house and ordered a Bottle of Claret—now I like Claret, whenever I can have Claret I must drink it,—’tis the only palate affair that I am at all sensual in. Would it not be a good speck to send you some vine roots—could it be done? I’ll enquire—If you could make some wine like Claret to drink on summer evenings in an arbour! For really ’tis so fine—it fills one’s mouth with a gushing freshness—then goes down cool and feverless—then[Pg 223] you do not feel it quarrelling with your liver—no, it is rather a Peacemaker, and lies as quiet as it did in the grape; then it is as fragrant as the Queen Bee, and the more ethereal Part of it mounts into the brain, not assaulting the cerebral apartments like a bully in a bad-house looking for his trull and hurrying from door to door bouncing against the wainstcoat, but rather walks like Aladdin about his own enchanted palace so gently that you do not feel his step. Other wines of a heavy and spirituous nature transform a Man to a Silenus: this makes him a Hermes—and gives a Woman the soul and immortality of Ariadne, for whom Bacchus always kept a good cellar of claret—and even of that he could never persuade her to take above two cups. I said this same claret is the only palate-passion I have—I forgot game—I must plead guilty to the breast of a Partridge, the back of a hare, the backbone of a grouse, the wing and side of a Pheasant and a Woodcock passim. Talking of game (I wish I could make it), the Lady whom I met at Hastings and of whom I said something in my last I think has lately made me many presents of game, and enabled me to make as many. She made me take home a Pheasant the other day, which I gave to Mrs. Dilke; on which to-morrow Rice, Reynolds and the Wentworthians will dine next door. The next I intend for your Mother. These moderate sheets of paper are much more pleasant to write upon than those large thin sheets which I hope you by this time have received—though that can’t be, now I think of it. I have not said in any Letter yet a word about my affairs—in a word I am in no despair about them—my poem has not at all succeeded; in the course of a year or so I think I shall try the public again—in a selfish point of view I should suffer my pride and my contempt of public opinion to hold me silent—but for yours and Fanny’s sake I will pluck up a spirit and try again. I have no doubt of success in a course of years if I persevere—but it must be patience, for the Reviews have enervated and[Pg 224] made indolent men’s minds—few think for themselves. These Reviews too are getting more and more powerful, especially the Quarterly—they are like a superstition which the more it prostrates the Crowd and the longer it continues the more powerful it becomes just in proportion to their increasing weakness. I was in hopes that when people saw, as they must do now, all the trickery and iniquity of these Plagues they would scout them, but no, they are like the spectators at the Westminster cock-pit—they like the battle and do not care who wins or who loses. Brown is going on this morning with the story of his old woman and the Devil—He makes but slow progress—The fact is it is a Libel on the Devil, and as that person is Brown’s Muse, look ye, if he libels his own Muse how can he expect to write? Either Brown or his Muse must turn tail. Yesterday was Charley Dilke’s birthday. Brown and I were invited to tea. During the evening nothing passed worth notice but a little conversation between Mrs. Dilke and Mrs. Brawne. The subject was the Watchman. It was ten o’clock, and Mrs. Brawne, who lived during the summer in Brown’s house and now lives in the Road, recognised her old Watchman’s voice, and said that he came as far as her now. “Indeed,” said Mrs. D., “does he turn the Corner?” There have been some Letters passed between me and Haslam but I have not seen him lately. The day before yesterday—which I made a day of Business—I called upon him—he was out as usual. Brown has been walking up and down the room a-breeding—now at this moment he is being delivered of a couplet, and I daresay will be as well as can be expected. Gracious—he has twins!

I have a long story to tell you about Bailey—I will say first the circumstances as plainly and as well as I can remember, and then I will make my comment. You know that Bailey was very much cut up about a little Jilt in the country somewhere. I thought he was in a dying state about it when at Oxford[Pg 225] with him: little supposing, as I have since heard, that he was at that very time making impatient Love to Marian Reynolds—and guess my astonishment at hearing after this that he had been trying at Miss Martin. So Matters have been—So Matters stood—when he got ordained and went to a Curacy near Carlisle, where the family of the Gleigs reside. There his susceptible heart was conquered by Miss Gleig—and thereby all his connections in town have been annulled—both male and female. I do not now remember clearly the facts—These however I know—He showed his correspondence with Marian to Gleig, returned all her Letters and asked for his own—he also wrote very abrupt Letters to Mrs. Reynolds. I do not know any more of the Martin affair than I have written above. No doubt his conduct has been very bad. The great thing to be considered is—whether it is want of delicacy and principle or want of knowledge and polite experience. And again weakness—yes, that is it; and the want of a Wife—yes, that is it; and then Marian made great Bones of him although her Mother and sister have teased her very much about it. Her conduct has been very upright throughout the whole affair—She liked Bailey as a Brother but not as a Husband—especially as he used to woo her with the Bible and Jeremy Taylor under his arm—they walked in no grove but Jeremy Taylor’s. Marian’s obstinacy is some excuse, but his so quickly taking to Miss Gleig can have no excuse—except that of a Ploughman who wants a wife. The thing which sways me more against him than anything else is Rice’s conduct on the occasion; Rice would not make an immature resolve: he was ardent in his friendship for Bailey, he examined the whole for and against minutely; and he has abandoned Bailey entirely. All this I am not supposed by the Reynoldses to have any hint of. It will be a good lesson to the Mother and Daughters—nothing would serve but Bailey. If you mentioned the word Tea-pot some one of them came out with an[Pg 226] à propros about Bailey—noble fellow—fine fellow! was always in their mouths—This may teach them that the man who ridicules romance is the most romantic of Men—that he who abuses women and slights them loves them the most—that he who talks of roasting a Man alive would not do it when it came to the push—and above all, that they are very shallow people who take everything literally. A Man’s life of any worth is a continual allegory, and very few eyes can see the Mystery of his life—a life like the scriptures, figurative—which such people can no more make out than they can the Hebrew Bible. Lord Byron cuts a figure but he is not figurative—Shakspeare led a life of Allegory: his works are the comments on it—


March 12, Friday.

I went to town yesterday chiefly for the purpose of seeing some young Men who were to take some Letters for us to you—through the medium of Peachey. I was surprised and disappointed at hearing they had changed their minds, and did not purpose going so far as Birkbeck’s. I was much disappointed, for I had counted upon seeing some persons who were to see you—and upon your seeing some who had seen me. I have not only lost this opportunity, but the sail of the Post-Packet to New York or Philadelphia, by which last your Brothers have sent some Letters. The weather in town yesterday was so stifling that I could not remain there though I wanted much to see Kean in Hotspur. I have by me at present Hazlitt’s Letter to Gifford—perhaps you would like an extract or two from the high-seasoned parts. It begins thus:

“Sir, you have an ugly trick of saying what is not true of any one you do not like; and it will be the object of this Letter to cure you of it. You say what you please of others; it is time you were told what you are. In doing this give me leave to borrow the familiarity of your style:—for the fidelity of the picture I shall be answerable. You are a little person but a considerable cat’s paw; and so far worthy of notice. Your clandestine connection with persons high in office constantly influences your opinions and[Pg 227] alone gives importance to them. You are the government critic, a character nicely differing from that of a government spy—the invisible link which connects literature with the Police.”

Again:

“Your employers, Mr. Gifford, do not pay their hirelings for nothing—for condescending to notice weak and wicked sophistry; for pointing out to contempt what excites no admiration; for cautiously selecting a few specimens of bad taste and bad grammar where nothing else is to be found. They want your invisible pertness, your mercenary malice, your impenetrable dulness, your bare-faced impudence, your pragmatical self-sufficiency, your hypocritical zeal, your pious frauds to stand in the gap of their Prejudices and pretensions to fly-blow and taint public opinion, to defeat independent efforts, to apply not the touch of the scorpion but the touch of the Torpedo to youthful hopes, to crawl and leave the slimy track of sophistry and lies over every work that does not dedicate its sweet leaves to some Luminary of the treasury bench, or is not fostered in the hotbed of corruption. This is your office; ‘this is what is look’d for at your hands, and this you do not baulk’—to sacrifice what little honesty and prostitute what little intellect you possess to any dirty job you are commission’d to execute. ‘They keep you as an ape does an apple in the corner of his jaw, first mouth’d to be at last swallow’d.’ You are by appointment literary toadeater to greatness and taster to the court. You have a natural aversion to whatever differs from your own pretensions, and an acquired one for what gives offence to your superiors. Your vanity panders to your interest, and your malice truckles only to your love of Power. If your instructive or premeditated abuse of your enviable trust were found wanting in a single instance; if you were to make a single slip in getting up your select committee of enquiry and green bag report of the state of Letters, your occupation would be gone. You would never after obtain a squeeze of the hand from acquaintance, or a smile from a Punk of Quality. The great and powerful whom you call wise and good do not like to have the privacy of their self-love startled by the obtrusive and unmanageable claims of Literature and Philosophy, except through the intervention of people like you, whom, if they have common penetration, they soon find out to be without any superiority of intellect; or if they do not, whom they can despise for their meanness of soul. You ‘have the office opposite to Saint Peter.’ You keep a corner in the public mind for foul prejudice and corrupt power to knot and gender in; you volunteer your services to people of quality to ease scruples of mind and qualms of conscience; you lay the flattering unction of venal prose and laurell’d verse to their souls. You persuade them that there is neither purity of morals, nor depth of understanding[Pg 228] except in themselves and their hangers-on; and would prevent the unhallow’d names of Liberty and humanity from ever being whispered in ears polite! You, sir, do you not all this? I cry you mercy then: I took you for the Editor of the Quarterly Review.”

This is the sort of feu de joie he keeps up. There is another extract or two—one especially which I will copy to-morrow—for the candles are burnt down and I am using the wax taper—which has a long snuff on it—the fire is at its last click—I am sitting with my back to it with one foot rather askew upon the rug and the other with the heel a little elevated from the carpet—I am writing this on the Maid’s Tragedy, which I have read since tea with great pleasure—Besides this volume of Beaumont and Fletcher, there are on the table two volumes of Chaucer and a new work of Tom Moore’s, called Tom Cribb’s Memorial to Congress—nothing in it. These are trifles—but I require nothing so much of you but that you will give one a like description of yourselves, however it may be when you are writing to me. Could I see the same thing done of any great Man long since dead it would be a great delight: as to know in what position Shakspeare sat when he began “To be or not to be”—such things become interesting from distance of time or place. I hope you are both now in that sweet sleep which no two beings deserve more than you do—I must fancy so—and please myself in the fancy of speaking a prayer and a blessing over you and your lives—God bless you—I whisper good-night in your ears, and you will dream of me.


March 13, Saturday.

I have written to Fanny this morning and received a note from Haslam. I was to have dined with him to-morrow: he gives me a bad account of his Father, who has not been in Town for five weeks, and is not well enough for company. Haslam is well—and from the prosperous state of some love affair he does not mind the double tides he has to work. I have been a Walk past west end—and was going to call at Mr. [Pg 229]Monkhouse’s—but I did not, not being in the humour. I know not why Poetry and I have been so distant lately; I must make some advances soon or she will cut me entirely. Hazlitt has this fine Passage in his Letter: Gifford in his Review of Hazlitt’s characters of Shakspeare’s plays attacks the Coriolanus critique. He says that Hazlitt has slandered Shakspeare in saying that he had a leaning to the arbitrary side of the question. Hazlitt thus defends himself,

“My words are, ‘Coriolanus is a storehouse of political commonplaces. The Arguments for and against aristocracy and democracy on the Privileges of the few and the claims of the many, on Liberty and slavery, power and the abuse of it, peace and war, are here very ably handled, with the spirit of a Poet and the acuteness of a Philosopher. Shakspeare himself seems to have had a leaning to the arbitrary side of the question, perhaps from some feeling of contempt for his own origin, and to have spared no occasion of bating the rabble. What he says of them is very true; what he says of their betters is also very true, though he dwells less upon it.’ I then proceed to account for this by showing how it is that ‘the cause of the people is but little calculated for a subject for poetry; or that the language of Poetry naturally falls in with the language of power.’ I affirm, Sir, that Poetry, that the imagination generally speaking, delights in power, in strong excitement, as well as in truth, in good, in right, whereas pure reason and the moral sense approve only of the true and good. I proceed to show that this general love or tendency to immediate excitement or theatrical effect, no matter how produced, gives a Bias to the imagination often consistent with the greatest good, that in Poetry it triumphs over principle, and bribes the passions to make a sacrifice of common humanity. You say that it does not, that there is no such original Sin in Poetry, that it makes no such sacrifice or unworthy compromise between poetical effect and the still small voice of reason. And how do you prove that there is no such principle giving a bias to the imagination and a false colouring to poetry? Why, by asking in reply to the instances where this principle operates, and where no other can with much modesty and simplicity—‘But are these the only topics that afford delight in Poetry, etc.?’ No; but these objects do afford delight in poetry, and they afford it in proportion to their strong and often tragical effect, and not in proportion to the good produced, or their desireableness in a moral point of view. Do we read with more pleasure of the ravages of a beast of prey than of the Shepherd’s pipe upon the Mountain? No; but we do read[Pg 230] with pleasure of the ravages of a beast of prey, and we do so on the principle I have stated, namely, from the sense of power abstracted from the sense of good; and it is the same principle that makes us read with admiration and reconciles us in fact to the triumphant progress of the conquerors and mighty Hunters of mankind, who come to stop the Shepherd’s Pipe upon the Mountains and sweep away his listening flock. Do you mean to deny that there is anything imposing to the imagination in power, in grandeur, in outward show, in the accumulation of individual wealth and luxury, at the expense of equal justice and the common weal? Do you deny that there is anything in the ‘Pride, Pomp, and Circumstance of glorious war, that makes ambition virtue’ in the eyes of admiring multitudes? Is this a new theory of the pleasures of the imagination, which says that the pleasures of the imagination do not take rise solely in the calculation of the understanding? Is it a paradox of my creating that ‘one murder makes a villain millions a Hero’? or is it not true that here, as in other cases, the enormity of the evil overpowers and makes a convert of the imagination by its very magnitude? You contradict my reasoning because you know nothing of the question, and you think that no one has a right to understand what you do not. My offence against purity in the passage alluded to, ‘which contains the concentrated venom of my malignity,’ is that I have admitted that there are tyrants and slaves abroad in the world; and you would hush the matter up and pretend that there is no such thing in order that there may be nothing else. Further, I have explained the cause, the subtle sophistry of the human mind, that tolerates and pampers the evil in order to guard against its approaches; you would conceal the cause in order to prevent the cure, and to leave the proud flesh about the heart to harden and ossify into one impenetrable mass of selfishness and hypocrisy, that we may not ‘sympathise in the distresses of suffering virtue’ in any case in which they come in competition with the fictitious wants and ‘imputed weaknesses of the great.’ You ask, ‘Are we gratified by the cruelties of Domitian or Nero?’ No, not we—they were too petty and cowardly to strike the imagination at a distance; but the Roman senate tolerated them, addressed their perpetrators, exalted them into gods, the fathers of the people, they had pimps and scribblers of all sorts in their pay, their Senecas, etc., till a turbulent rabble, thinking there were no injuries to Society greater than the endurance of unlimited and wanton oppression, put an end to the farce and abated the sin as well as they could. Had you and I lived in those times we should have been what we are now, I ‘a sour malcontent,’ and you ‘a sweet courtier.’”

The manner in which this is managed: the force and innate power with which it yeasts and works up[Pg 231] itself—the feeling for the costume of society; is in a style of genius. He hath a demon, as he himself says of Lord Byron. We are to have a party this evening. The Davenports from Church Row—I don’t think you know anything of them—they have paid me a good deal of attention. I like Davenport himself. The names of the rest are Miss Barnes, Miss Winter with the Children.


[Later, March 17 or 18.]

On Monday we had to dinner Severn and Cawthorn, the Bookseller and print-virtuoso; in the evening Severn went home to paint, and we other three went to the play, to see Sheil’s new tragedy ycleped Evadné. In the morning Severn and I took a turn round the Museum—There is a Sphinx there of a giant size, and most voluptuous Egyptian expression, I had not seen it before. The play was bad even in comparison with 1818, the Augustan age of the Drama, “comme on sait,” as Voltaire says—the whole was made up of a virtuous young woman, an indignant brother, a suspecting lover, a libertine prince, a gratuitous villain, a street in Naples, a Cypress grove, lilies and roses, virtue and vice, a bloody sword, a spangled jacket, one Lady Olivia, one Miss O’Neil alias Evadné, alias Bellamira, alias—Alias—Yea, and I say unto you a greater than Elias—There was Abbot, and talking of Abbot his name puts me in mind of a spelling-book lesson, descriptive of the whole Dramatis personæ—Abbot—Abbess—Actor—Actress—The play is a fine amusement, as a friend of mine once said to me—“Do what you will,” says he, “a poor gentleman who wants a guinea, cannot spend his two shillings better than at the playhouse.” The pantomime was excellent, I had seen it before and I enjoyed it again. Your Mother and I had some talk about Miss H.—— Says I, will Henry have that Miss ——, a lath with a boddice, she who has been fine drawn—fit for nothing but to cut up into Cribbage pins, to the tune of 15.2; one who is all muslin; all feathers and bone; once in travelling she[Pg 232] was made use of as a lynch pin; I hope he will not have her, though it is no uncommon thing to be smitten with a staff; though she might be very useful as his walking-stick, his fishing-rod, his tooth-pik, his hat-stick (she runs so much in his head)—let him turn farmer, she would cut into hurdles; let him write poetry, she would be his turn-style. Her gown is like a flag on a pole; she would do for him if he turn freemason; I hope she will prove a flag of truce; when she sits languishing with her one foot on a stool, and one elbow on the table, and her head inclined, she looks like the sign of the crooked billet—or the frontispiece to Cinderella, or a tea-paper wood-cut of Mother Shipton at her studies; she is a make-believe—She is bona side a thin young ’oman—But this is mere talk of a fellow-creature; yet pardie I would not that Henry have her—Non volo ut eam possideat, nam, for, it would be a bam, for it would be a sham—

Don’t think I am writing a petition to the Governors of St. Luke—no, that would be in another style. May it please your Worships; forasmuch as the undersigned has committed, transferred, given up, made over, consigned, and aberrated himself, to the art and mystery of poetry; forasmuch as he hath cut, rebuffed, affronted, huffed, and shirked, and taken stint at, all other employments, arts, mysteries, and occupations, honest, middling, and dishonest; forasmuch as he hath at sundry times and in divers places, told truth unto the men of this generation, and eke to the women; moreover, forasmuch as he hath kept a pair of boots that did not fit, and doth not admire Sheil’s play, Leigh Hunt, Tom Moore, Bob Southey, and Mr. Rogers; and does admire Wm. Hazlitt; moreoverer for as more as he liketh half of Wordsworth, and none of Crabbe; moreover-est for as most as he hath written this page of penmanship—he prayeth your Worships to give him a lodging—Witnessed by Rd. Abbey and Co., cum familiaribus et consanguineis (signed) Count de Cockaigne.

The nothing of the day is a machine called the velocipede.[Pg 233] It is a wheel carriage to ride cock-horse upon, sitting astride and pushing it along with the toes, a rudder wheel in hand—they will go seven miles an hour—A handsome gelding will come to eight guineas; however they will soon be cheaper, unless the army takes to them. I look back upon the last month, I find nothing to write about; indeed I do not recollect anything particular in it. It’s all alike; we keep on breathing. The only amusement is a little scandal, of however fine a shape, a laugh at a pun—and then after all we wonder how we could enjoy the scandal, or laugh at the pun.

I have been at different times turning it in my head whether I should go to Edinburgh and study for a physician; I am afraid I should not take kindly to it; I am sure I could not take fees—and yet I should like to do so; it’s not worse than writing poems, and hanging them up to be fly-blown on the Review shambles. Everybody is in his own mess. Here is the parson at Hampstead quarrelling with all the world, he is in the wrong by this same token; when the black cloth was put up in the Church for the Queen’s mourning, he asked the workmen to hang it the wrong side outwards, that it might be better when taken down, it being his perquisite—Parsons will always keep up their character, but as it is said there are some animals the ancients knew which we do not, let us hope our posterity will miss the black badger with tri-cornered hat; Who knows but some Reviewer of Buffon or Pliny may put an account of the parson in the Appendix; No one will then believe it any more than we believe in the Phœnix. I think we may class the lawyer in the same natural history of Monsters; a green bag will hold as much as a lawn sleeve. The only difference is that one is fustian and the other flimsy; I am not unwilling to read Church history at present and have Milner’s in my eye; his is reckoned a very good one.


[Pg 234]18th September 1819.

[In looking over some of my papers I found the above specimen of my carelessness. It is a sheet you ought to have had long ago—my letter must have appeared very unconnected, but as I number the sheets you must have discovered how the mistake happened. How many things have happened since I wrote it—How have I acted contrary to my resolves. The interval between writing this sheet and the day I put this supplement to it, has been completely filled with generous and most friendly actions of Brown towards me. How frequently I forget to speak of things which I think of and feel most. ’Tis very singular, the idea about Buffon above has been taken up by Hunt in the Examiner, in some papers which he calls “A Preter-natural History.”][90]


Friday 19th March.

This morning I have been reading “the False One.” Shameful to say, I was in bed at ten—I mean this morning. The Blackwood Reviewers have committed themselves in a scandalous heresy—they have been putting up Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, against Burns: the senseless villains! The Scotch cannot manage themselves at all, they want imagination, and that is why they are so fond of Hogg, who has a little of it. This morning I am in a sort of temper, indolent and supremely careless—I long after a Stanza or two of Thomson’s Castle of Indolence—my passions are all asleep, from my having slumbered till nearly eleven, and weakened the animal fibre all over me, to a delightful sensation, about three degrees on this side of faintness. If I had teeth of pearl and the breath of lilies I should call it[Pg 235] languor, but as I am[B] I must call it laziness. In this state of effeminacy the fibres of the brain are relaxed in common with the rest of the body, and to such a happy degree that pleasure has no show of enticement and pain no unbearable power. Neither Poetry, nor Ambition, nor Love have any alertness of countenance as they pass by me; they seem rather like figures on a Greek vase—a Man and two women whom no one but myself could distinguish in their disguisement.[91] This is the only happiness, and is a rare instance of the advantage of the body overpowering the Mind. I have this moment received a note from Haslam, in which he expects the death of his Father, who has been for some time in a state of insensibility; his mother bears up he says very well—I shall go to town to-morrow to see him. This is the world—thus we cannot expect to give way many hours to pleasure. Circumstances are like Clouds continually gathering and bursting—While we are laughing, the seed of some trouble is put into the wide arable land of events—while we are laughing it sprouts it grows and suddenly bears a poison fruit which we must pluck. Even so we have leisure to reason on the misfortunes of our friends; our own touch us too nearly for words. Very few men have ever arrived at a complete disinterestedness of Mind: very few have been influenced by a pure desire of the benefit of others,—in the greater part of the Benefactors to Humanity some meretricious motive has sullied their greatness—some melodramatic scenery has fascinated them. From the manner in which I feel Haslam’s misfortune I perceive how far I am from any humble standard of disinterestedness. Yet this feeling[Pg 236] ought to be carried to its highest pitch, as there is no fear of its ever injuring society—which it would do, I fear, pushed to an extremity. For in wild nature the Hawk would lose his Breakfast of Robins and the Robin his of Worms—The Lion must starve as well as the swallow. The greater part of Men make their way with the same instinctiveness, the same unwandering eye from their purposes, the same animal eagerness as the Hawk. The Hawk wants a Mate, so does the Man—look at them both, they set about it and procure one in the same manner. They want both a nest and they both set about one in the same manner—they get their food in the same manner. The noble animal Man for his amusement smokes his pipe—the Hawk balances about the Clouds—that is the only difference of their leisures. This it is that makes the Amusement of Life—to a speculative Mind—I go among the Fields and catch a glimpse of a Stoat or a fieldmouse peeping out of the withered grass—the creature hath a purpose, and its eyes are bright with it. I go amongst the buildings of a city and I see a Man hurrying along—to what? the Creature has a purpose and his eyes are bright with it. But then, as Wordsworth says, “we have all one human heart——” There is an electric fire in human nature tending to purify—so that among these human creatures there is continually some birth of new heroism. The pity is that we must wonder at it, as we should at finding a pearl in rubbish. I have no doubt that thousands of people never heard of have had hearts completely disinterested: I can remember but two—Socrates and Jesus—Their histories evince it. What I heard a little time ago, Taylor observe with respect to Socrates, may be said of Jesus—That he was so great a man that though he transmitted no writing of his own to posterity, we have his Mind and his sayings and his greatness handed to us by others. It is to be lamented that the history of the latter was written and revised by Men interested in the pious frauds of Religion. Yet through all this I see his splendour. Even here, though[Pg 237] I myself am pursuing the same instinctive course as the veriest human animal you can think of, I am, however young, writing at random, straining at particles of light in the midst of a great darkness, without knowing the bearing of any one assertion, of any one opinion. Yet may I not in this be free from sin? May there not be superior beings amused with any graceful, though instinctive, attitude my mind may fall into as I am entertained with the alertness of a Stoat or the anxiety of a Deer? Though a quarrel in the Streets is a thing to be hated, the energies displayed in it are fine; the commonest Man shows a grace in his quarrel. By a superior Being our reasonings may take the same tone—though erroneous they may be fine. This is the very thing in which consists Poetry, and if so it is not so fine a thing as philosophy—For the same reason that an eagle is not so fine a thing as a truth. Give me this credit—Do you not think I strive—to know myself? Give me this credit, and you will not think that on my own account I repeat Milton’s lines—

“How charming is divine Philosophy,
Not harsh and crabbed, as dull fools suppose,
But musical as is Apollo’s lute.”

No—not for myself—feeling grateful as I do to have got into a state of mind to relish them properly. Nothing ever becomes real till it is experienced—Even a Proverb is no proverb to you till your Life has illustrated it. I am ever afraid that your anxiety for me will lead you to fear for the violence of my temperament continually smothered down: for that reason I did not intend to have sent you the following sonnet—but look over the two last pages and ask yourselves whether I have not that in me which will bear the buffets of the world. It will be the best comment on my sonnet; it will show you that it was written with no Agony but that of ignorance; with no thirst of anything but Knowledge when pushed to the point though the first steps to it were through my human passions—they went away and I wrote with my[Pg 238] Mind—and perhaps I must confess a little bit of my heart—

Why did I laugh to-night? No voice will tell:
No God, no Deamon of severe response
Deigns to reply from heaven or from Hell.—
Then to my human heart I turn at once—
Heart! thou and I are here sad and alone;
Say, wherefore did I laugh? O mortal pain!
O Darkness! Darkness! ever must I moan,
To question Heaven and Hell and Heart in vain!
Why did I laugh? I know this being’s lease,
My fancy to its utmost blisses spreads:
Yet could I on this very midnight cease,[92]
And the world’s gaudy ensigns see in shreds;
Verse, fame and Beauty are intense indeed
But Death intenser—Death is Life’s high meed.

I went to bed and enjoyed an uninterrupted sleep. Sane I went to bed and sane I arose.


[April 15.]

This is the 15th of April—you see what a time it is since I wrote; all that time I have been day by day expecting Letters from you. I write quite in the dark. In the hopes of a Letter daily I have deferred that I might write in the light. I was in town yesterday, and at Taylor’s heard that young Birkbeck had been in Town and was to set forward in six or seven days—so I shall dedicate that time to making up this parcel ready for him. I wish I could hear from you to make me “whole and general as the casing air.”[93] A few days after the 19th of April[94] I received a note from Haslam containing the news of his father’s death. The Family has all been well. Haslam has his father’s situation. The Framptons have behaved well to him. The day before yesterday I went to a rout at Sawrey’s—it was made pleasant by Reynolds being there and our getting into conversation with one of the most beautiful Girls I ever saw—She gave[Pg 239] a remarkable prettiness to all those commonplaces which most women who talk must utter—I liked Mrs. Sawrey very well. The Sunday before last your Brothers were to come by a long invitation—so long that for the time I forgot it when I promised Mrs. Brawne to dine with her on the same day. On recollecting my engagement with your Brothers I immediately excused myself with Mrs. Brawne, but she would not hear of it, and insisted on my bringing my friends with me. So we all dined at Mrs. Brawne’s. I have been to Mrs. Bentley’s this morning, and put all the letters to and from you and poor Tom and me.[95] I found some of the correspondence between him and that degraded Wells and Amena. It is a wretched business; I do not know the rights of it, but what I do know would, I am sure, affect you so much that I am in two minds whether I will tell you anything about it. And yet I do not see why—for anything, though it be unpleasant, that calls to mind those we still love has a compensation in itself for the pain it occasions—so very likely to-morrow I may set about copying the whole of what I have about it: with no sort of a Richardson self-satisfaction—I hate it to a sickness—and I am afraid more from indolence of mind than anything else. I wonder how people exist with all their worries. I have not been to Westminster but once lately, and that was to see Dilke in his new Lodgings—I think of living somewhere in the neighbourhood myself. Your mother was well by your Brothers’ account. I shall see her perhaps to-morrow—yes I shall. We have had the Boys[96] here lately—they make a bit of a racket—I shall not be sorry when they go. I found also this morning, in a note from George to you and my dear sister a lock of your hair which I shall this moment put in the miniature case. A few days ago Hunt dined here and Brown invited Davenport to meet him, Davenport from a sense of weakness thought it incumbent on him to show off—and[Pg 240] pursuant to that never ceased talking and boring all day till I was completely fagged out. Brown grew melancholy—but Hunt perceiving what a complimentary tendency all this had bore it remarkably well—Brown grumbled about it for two or three days. I went with Hunt to Sir John Leicester’s gallery; there I saw Northcote—Hilton—Bewick, and many more of great and Little note. Haydon’s picture is of very little progress this year—He talks about finishing it next year. Wordsworth is going to publish a Poem called Peter Bell—what a perverse fellow it is! Why will he talk about Peter Bells—I was told not to tell—but to you it will not be telling—Reynolds hearing that said Peter Bell was coming out, took it into his head to write a skit upon it called Peter Bell. He did it as soon as thought on, it is to be published this morning, and comes out before the real Peter Bell, with this admirable motto from the “Bold Stroke for a Wife” “I am the real Simon Pure.” It would be just as well to trounce Lord Byron in the same manner. I am still at a stand in versifying—I cannot do it yet with any pleasure—I mean, however, to look round on my resources and means, and see what I can do without poetry—To that end I shall live in Westminster—I have no doubt of making by some means a little to help on, or I shall be left in the Lurch—with the burden of a little Pride—However I look in time. The Dilkes like their Lodgings at Westminster tolerably well. I cannot help thinking what a shame it is that poor Dilke should give up his comfortable house and garden for his Son, whom he will certainly ruin with too much care. The boy has nothing in his ears all day but himself and the importance of his education. Dilke has continually in his mouth “My Boy.” This is what spoils princes: it may have the same effect with Commoners. Mrs. Dilke has been very well lately—But what a shameful thing it is that for that obstinate Boy Dilke should stifle himself in Town Lodgings and wear out his Life by his continual apprehension of his Boy’s[Pg 241] fate in Westminster school, with the rest of the Boys and the Masters. Every one has some wear and tear. One would think Dilke ought to be quiet and happy—but no—this one Boy makes his face pale, his society silent and his vigilance jealous—He would I have no doubt quarrel with any one who snubb’d his Boy—With all this he has no notion how to manage him. O what a farce is our greatest cares! Yet one must be in the pother for the sake of Clothes food and Lodging. There has been a squabble between Kean and Mr. Bucke—There are faults on both sides—on Bucke’s the faults are positive to the Question: Kean’s fault is a want of genteel knowledge and high Policy. The former writes knavishly foolish, and the other silly bombast. It was about a Tragedy written by said Mr. Bucke which, it appears, Mr. Kean kick’d at—it was so bad—After a little struggle of Mr. Bucke’s against Kean, Drury Lane had the Policy to bring it out and Kean the impolicy not to appear in it. It was damn’d. The people in the Pit had a favourite call on the night of “Buck, Buck, rise up” and “Buck, Buck, how many horns do I hold up.” Kotzebue the German Dramatist and traitor to his country was murdered lately by a young student whose name I forget—he stabbed himself immediately after crying out Germany! Germany! I was unfortunate to miss Richards the only time I have been for many months to see him.

Shall I treat you with a little extempore?—

When they were come into the Faery’s Court
They rang—no one at home—all gone to sport
And dance and kiss and love as faerys do
For Faries be as humans lovers true.
Amid the woods they were so lone and wild,
Where even the Robin feels himself exil’d,
And where the very brooks, as if afraid,
Hurry along to some less magic shade.
‘No one at home!’ the fretful princess cry’d;
‘And all for nothing such a dreary ride,
And all for nothing my new diamond cross;
No one to see my Persian feathers toss,
[Pg 242]No one to see my Ape, my Dwarf, my Fool,
Or how I pace my Otaheitan mule.
Ape, Dwarf, and Fool, why stand you gaping there,
Burst the door open, quick—or I declare
I’ll switch you soundly and in pieces tear.’
The Dwarf began to tremble, and the Ape
Star’d at the Fool, the Fool was all agape,
The Princess grasp’d her switch, but just in time
The dwarf with piteous face began to rhyme.
‘O mighty Princess, did you ne’er hear tell
What your poor servants know but too too well?
Know you the three great crimes in faery land?
The first, alas! poor Dwarf, I understand,
I made a whipstock of a faery’s wand;
The next is snoring in their company;
The next, the last, the direst of the three,
Is making free when they are not at home.
I was a Prince—a baby prince—my doom,
You see, I made a whipstock of a wand,
My top has henceforth slept in faery land.
He was a Prince, the Fool, a grown-up Prince,
But he has never been a King’s son since
He fell a snoring at a faery Ball.
Your poor Ape was a Prince, and he poor thing
Picklock’d a faery’s boudoir—now no king
But ape—so pray your highness stay awhile,
’Tis sooth indeed, we know it to our sorrow—
Persist and you may be an ape to-morrow.’
While the Dwarf spake the Princess, all for spite,
Peel’d the brown hazel twig to lilly white,
Clench’d her small teeth, and held her lips apart,
Try’d to look unconcern’d with beating heart.
They saw her highness had made up her mind,
A-quavering like the reeds before the wind—
And they had had it, but O happy chance
The Ape for very fear began to dance
And grinn’d as all his ugliness did ache—
She staid her vixen fingers for his sake,
He was so very ugly: then she took
Her pocket-mirror and began to look
First at herself and then at him, and then
She smil’d at her own beauteous face again.
Yet for all this—for all her pretty face—
She took it in her head to see the place.
Women gain little from experience
Either in Lovers, husbands, or expense.
The more their beauty the more fortune too—
[Pg 243]Beauty before the wide world never knew—
So each fair reasons—tho’ it oft miscarries.
She thought her pretty face would please the fairies.
‘My darling Ape I won’t whip you to-day,
Give me the Picklock sirrah and go play.’
They all three wept but counsel was as vain
As crying cup biddy to drops of rain.
Yet lingering by did the sad Ape forth draw
The Picklock from the Pocket in his Jaw.
The Princess took it, and dismounting straight
Tripp’d in blue silver’d slippers to the gate
And touch’d the wards, the Door full courteously
Opened—she enter’d with her servants three.
Again it clos’d and there was nothing seen
But the Mule grazing on the herbage green.

End of Canto XII.


Canto the XIII.

The Mule no sooner saw himself alone
Than he prick’d up his Ears—and said ‘well done;
At least unhappy Prince I may be free—
No more a Princess shall side-saddle me.
O King of Otaheite—tho’ a Mule,
Aye, every inch a King’—tho’ ‘Fortune’s fool,’
Well done—for by what Mr. Dwarfy said
I would not give a sixpence for her head.’
Even as he spake he trotted in high glee
To the knotty side of an old Pollard tree,
And rubb’d his sides against the mossed bark
Till his Girths burst and left him naked stark
Except his Bridle—how get rid of that
Buckled and tied with many a twist and plait.
At last it struck him to pretend to sleep,
And then the thievish Monkies down would creep
And filch the unpleasant trammels quite away.
No sooner thought of than adown he lay,
Shamm’d a good snore—the Monkey-men descended,
And whom they thought to injure they befriended.
They hung his Bridle on a topmost bough
And off he went run, trot, or anyhow—

Brown is gone to bed—and I am tired of rhyming—there is a north wind blowing playing young gooseberry with the trees—I don’t care so it helps even with a side wind a Letter to me—for I cannot put faith in any reports I hear of the Settlement; some are good and some bad.[Pg 244] Last Sunday I took a Walk towards Highgate and in the lane that winds by the side of Lord Mansfield’s park I met Mr. Green our Demonstrator at Guy’s in conversation with Coleridge—I joined them, after enquiring by a look whether it would be agreeable—I walked with him at his alderman-after-dinner pace for near two miles I suppose. In those two Miles he broached a thousand things—let me see if I can give you a list—Nightingales—Poetry—on Poetical Sensation—Metaphysics—Different genera and species of Dreams—Nightmare—a dream accompanied by a sense of touch—single and double touch—a dream related—First and second consciousness—the difference explained between will and Volition—so say metaphysicians from a want of smoking the second consciousness—Monsters—the Kraken—Mermaids—Southey believes in them—Southey’s belief too much diluted—a Ghost story—Good morning—I heard his voice as he came towards me—I heard it as he moved away—I had heard it all the interval—if it may be called so. He was civil enough to ask me to call on him at Highgate. Good-night!


[Later, April 16 or 17.]

It looks so much like rain I shall not go to town to-day: but put it off till to-morrow. Brown this morning is writing some Spenserian stanzas against Mrs., Miss Brawne and me; so I shall amuse myself with him a little: in the manner of Spenser—

He is to weet a melancholy Carle
Thin in the waist, with bushy head of hair
As hath the seeded thistle when in parle
It holds the Zephyr, ere it sendeth fair
Its light balloons into the summer air
Thereto his beard had not begun to bloom
No brush had touch’d his chin or razor sheer
No care had touch’d his cheek with mortal doom,
But new he was and bright as scarf from Persian loom.

Ne cared he for wine, or half-and-half
[Pg 245]Ne cared he for fish or flesh or fowl,
And sauces held he worthless as the chaff
He ’sdeign’d the swineherd at the wassail bowl
Ne with lewd ribbalds sat he cheek by jowl
Ne with sly Lemans in the scorner’s chair
But after water-brooks this Pilgrim’s soul
Panted, and all his food was woodland air
Though he would ofttimes feast on gilliflowers rare—

The slang of cities in no wise he knew
Tipping the wink to him was heathen Greek;
He sipp’d no olden Tom or ruin blue
Or nantz or cherry brandy drunk full meek
By many a Damsel hoarse and rouge of cheek
Nor did he know each aged Watchman’s beat—
Nor in obscured purlieus would he seek
For curled Jewesses, with ankles neat
Who as they walk abroad make tinkling with their feet.

This character would ensure him a situation in the establishment of patient Griselda. The servant has come for the little Browns this morning—they have been a toothache to me which I shall enjoy the riddance of—Their little voices are like wasps’ stings—Sometimes am I all wound with Browns.[97] We had a claret feast some little while ago. There were Dilke, Reynolds, Skinner, Mancur, John Brown, Martin, Brown and I. We all got a little tipsy—but pleasantly so—I enjoy Claret to a degree.


[Later, April 18 or 19.]

I have been looking over the correspondence of the pretended Amena and Wells this evening—I now see the whole cruel deception. I think Wells must have had an accomplice in it—Amena’s letters are in a Man’s language and in a Man’s hand imitating a woman’s. The instigations to this diabolical scheme were vanity, and the love of intrigue. It was no thoughtless hoax—but a cruel deception on a sanguine Temperament, with every show of friendship. I do not think death too bad for the villain. The world would look upon it in a different[Pg 246] light should I expose it—they would call it a frolic—so I must be wary—but I consider it my duty to be prudently revengeful. I will hang over his head like a sword by a hair. I will be opium to his vanity—if I cannot injure his interests—He is a rat and he shall have ratsbane to his vanity—I will harm him all I possibly can—I have no doubt I shall be able to do so—Let us leave him to his misery alone, except when we can throw in a little more. The fifth canto of Dante pleases me more and more—it is that one in which he meets with Paolo and Francesca. I had passed many days in rather a low state of mind, and in the midst of them I dreamt of being in that region of Hell. The dream was one of the most delightful enjoyments I ever had in my life. I floated about the whirling atmosphere, as it is described, with a beautiful figure, to whose lips mine were joined as it seemed for an age—and in the midst of all this cold and darkness I was warm—even flowery tree-tops sprung up, and we rested on them, sometimes with the lightness of a cloud, till the wind blew us away again. I tried a sonnet upon it—there are fourteen lines, but nothing of what I felt in it—O that I could dream it every night—

As Hermes once took to his feathers light
When lulled Argus, baffled, swoon’d and slept,
So on a delphic reed my idle spright
So play’d, so charm’d, so conquer’d, so bereft
The Dragon world of all its hundred eyes;
And seeing it asleep, so fled away;—
Not to pure Ida with its snow-cold skies,
Nor unto Tempe where Jove grieved that day;
But to that second circle of sad Hell
Where in the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw
Of Rain and hailstones, lovers need not tell
Their sorrows. Pale were the sweet lips I saw,
Pale were the lips I kiss’d, and fair the form
I floated with about that melancholy storm.

I want very very much a little of your wit, my dear Sister—a Letter or two of yours just to bandy back a pun or two across the Atlantic, and send a quibble over[Pg 247] the Floridas. Now you have by this time crumpled up your large Bonnet, what do you wear—a cap? do you put your hair in papers of a night? do you pay the Miss Birkbecks a morning visit—have you any tea? or do you milk-and-water with them—What place of Worship do you go to—the Quakers, the Moravians, the Unitarians, or the Methodists? Are there any flowers in bloom you like—any beautiful heaths—any streets full of Corset Makers? What sort of shoes have you to fit those pretty feet of yours? Do you desire Compliments to one another? Do you ride on Horseback? What do you have for breakfast, dinner, and supper? without mentioning lunch and bever,[98] and wet and snack—and a bit to stay one’s stomach? Do you get any Spirits—now you might easily distill some whiskey—and going into the woods, set up a whiskey shop for the Monkeys—Do you and the Miss Birkbecks get groggy on anything—a little so-soish so as to be obliged to be seen home with a Lantern? You may perhaps have a game at puss in the corner—Ladies are warranted to play at this game though they have not whiskers. Have you a fiddle in the Settlement—or at any rate a Jew’s harp—which will play in spite of one’s teeth—When you have nothing else to do for a whole day I tell you how you may employ it—First get up and when you are dressed, as it would be pretty early with a high wind in the woods, give George a cold Pig with my Compliments. Then you may saunter into the nearest coffee-house, and after taking a dram and a look at the Chronicle—go and frighten the wild boars upon the strength—you may as well bring one home for breakfast, serving up the hoofs garnished with bristles and a grunt or two to accompany the singing of the kettle—then if George is not up give him a colder Pig always with my Compliments—When you are both set down to breakfast I advise you to eat your[Pg 248] full share, but leave off immediately on feeling yourself inclined to anything on the other side of the puffy—avoid that, for it does not become young women—After you have eaten your breakfast keep your eye upon dinner—it is the safest way—You should keep a Hawk’s eye over your dinner and keep hovering over it till due time then pounce taking care not to break any plates. While you are hovering with your dinner in prospect you may do a thousand things—put a hedgehog into George’s hat—pour a little water into his rifle—soak his boots in a pail of water—cut his jacket round into shreds like a Roman kilt or the back of my grandmother’s stays—Sew off his buttons—


[Later, April 21 or 22.]

Yesterday I could not write a line I was so fatigued, for the day before I went to town in the morning, called on your Mother, and returned in time for a few friends we had to dinner. These were Taylor, Woodhouse, Reynolds: we began cards at about 9 o’clock, and the night coming on, and continuing dark and rainy, they could not think of returning to town—So we played at Cards till very daylight—and yesterday I was not worth a sixpence. Your Mother was very well but anxious for a Letter. We had half an hour’s talk and no more, for I was obliged to be home. Mrs. and Miss Millar were well, and so was Miss Waldegrave. I have asked your Brothers here for next Sunday. When Reynolds was here on Monday he asked me to give Hunt a hint to take notice of his Peter Bell in the Examiner—the best thing I can do is to write a little notice of it myself, which I will do here, and copy out if it should suit my Purpose—

Peter Bell. There have been lately advertised two Books both Peter Bell by name; what stuff the one was made of might be seen by the motto—“I am the real Simon Pure.” This false Florimel has hurried from the press and obtruded herself into public notice, while for aught we know the real one may be still wandering about the woods and mountains. Let us hope she may soon[Pg 249] appear and make good her right to the magic girdle. The Pamphleteering Archimage, we can perceive, has rather a splenetic love than a downright hatred to real Florimels—if indeed they had been so christened—or had even a pretention to play at bob cherry with Barbara Lewthwaite: but he has a fixed aversion to those three rhyming Graces Alice Fell, Susan Gale and Betty Foy; and now at length especially to Peter Bell—fit Apollo. It may be seen from one or two Passages in this little skit, that the writer of it has felt the finer parts of Mr. Wordsworth, and perhaps expatiated with his more remote and sublimer muse. This as far as it relates to Peter Bell is unlucky. The more he may love the sad embroidery of the Excursion, the more he will hate the coarse Samplers of Betty Foy and Alice Fell; and as they come from the same hand, the better will he be able to imitate that which can be imitated, to wit Peter Bell—as far as can be imagined from the obstinate Name. We repeat, it is very unlucky—this real Simon Pure is in parts the very Man—there is a pernicious likeness in the scenery, a ‘pestilent humour’ in the rhymes, and an inveterate cadence in some of the Stanzas, that must be lamented. If we are one part amused with this we are three parts sorry that an appreciator of Wordsworth should show so much temper at this really provoking name of Peter Bell—![99]

This will do well enough—I have copied it and enclosed it to Hunt. You will call it a little politic—seeing I keep clear of all parties. I say something for and against both parties—and suit it to the tune of the Examiner—I meant to say I do not unsuit it—and I believe I think what I say, nay I am sure I do—I and my conscience are in luck to-day—which is an excellent thing. The other night I went to the Play with Rice, Reynolds, and Martin—we saw a new dull and half-damn’d opera call’d the ‘Heart of Midlothian,’ that was[Pg 250] on Saturday—I stopt at Taylor’s on Sunday with Woodhouse—and passed a quiet sort of pleasant day. I have been very much pleased with the Panorama of the Ship at the North Pole—with the icebergs, the Mountains, the Bears, the Wolves—the seals, the Penguins—and a large whale floating back above water—it is impossible to describe the place—


Wednesday Evening [April 28].

LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI

O what can ail thee Knight at arms
Alone and palely loitering?
The sedge has withered from the Lake
And no birds sing!

O what can ail thee Knight at arms
So haggard, and so woe-begone?
The squirrel’s granary is full
And the harvest’s done.

I see a lily on thy brow,
With anguish moist and fever dew,
And on thy cheek a fading rose
Fast Withereth too—

I met a Lady in the Meads
Full beautiful, a faery’s child—
Her hair was long, her foot was light
And her eyes were wild—

I made a Garland for her head,
And bracelets too, and fragrant Zone
She look’d at me as she did love
And made sweet moan—

I set her on my pacing steed
And nothing else saw all day long,
For sidelong would she bend and sing
A faery’s song—

She found me roots of relish sweet
And honey wild and manna dew
And sure in language strange she said
I love thee true—

She took me to her elfin grot
And there she wept and sigh’d full sore,
And there I shut her wild, wild eyes
With kisses four—
[Pg 251]
And there she lulled me asleep,
And there I dream’d Ah Woe betide!
The latest dream I ever dreamt
On the cold hill side.

I saw pale Kings and Princes too
Pale warriors death-pale were they all
They cried—La belle dame sans merci
Thee hath in thrall.

I saw their starv’d lips in the gloam
With horrid warning gaped wide,
And I awoke, and found me here
On the cold hill’s side.

And this is why I sojourn here
Alone and palely loitering;
Though the sedge is withered from the Lake
And no birds sing.[100]...

Why four kisses—you will say—why four, because I wish to restrain the headlong impetuosity of my Muse—she would have fain said “score” without hurting the rhyme—but we must temper the Imagination, as the Critics say, with Judgment. I was obliged to choose an even number, that both eyes might have fair play, and to speak truly I think two a piece quite sufficient. Suppose I had said seven there would have been three and a half a piece—a very awkward affair, and well got out of on my side—


[Later.]

CHORUS OF FAIRIES.
4—FIRE, AIR, EARTH, AND WATER—
SALAMANDER, ZEPHYR, DUSKETHA, BREAMA.

Sal.      Happy happy glowing fire!
Zep.     Fragrant air, delicious light!
Dusk.   Let me to my glooms retire.
Bream. I to greenweed rivers bright.

[Pg 252]Salam.
Happy, happy glowing fire!
Dazzling bowers of soft retire,
Ever let my nourish’d wing,
Like a bat’s still wandering,
Faintly fan your fiery spaces
Spirit sole in deadly places,
In unhaunted roar and blaze
Open eyes that never daze
Let me see the myriad shapes
Of Men and Beasts and Fish and apes,
Portray’d in many a fiery den,
And wrought by spumy bitumen
On the deep intenser roof,
Arched every way aloof.
Let me breathe upon my skies,
And anger their live tapestries;
Free from cold and every care,
Of chilly rain and shivering air.

Zephyr.
Spright of fire—away away!
Or your very roundelay
Will sear my plumage newly budded
From its quilled sheath and studded
With the self-same dews that fell
On the May-grown Asphodel.
Spright of fire away away!

Breama.
Spright of fire away away!
Zephyr blue-eyed faery turn,
And see my cool sedge-shaded urn,
Where it rests its mossy brim
Mid water-mint and cresses dim;
And the flowers, in sweet troubles,
Lift their eyes above the bubbles,
Like our Queen when she would please
To sleep, and Oberon will tease—
Love me blue-eyed Faery true
Soothly I am sick for you.

Zephyr.
Gentle Breama! by the first
Violet young nature nurst,
I will bathe myself with thee,
[Pg 253]So you sometime follow me
To my home far far in west,
Far beyond the search and quest
Of the golden-browed sun.
Come with me, o’er tops of trees,
To my fragrant Palaces,
Where they ever-floating are
Beneath the cherish of a star
Call’d Vesper—who with silver veil
Ever Hides his brilliance pale,
Ever gently drows’d doth keep
Twilight of the Fays to sleep.
Fear not that your watery hair
Will thirst in drouthy ringlets there—
Clouds of stored summer rains
Thou shalt taste before the stains
Of the mountain soil they take,
And too unlucent for thee make.
I love thee, Crystal faery true
Sooth I am as sick for you—

Salam.
Out ye agueish Faeries out!
Chilly Lovers, what a rout
Keep ye with your frozen breath
Colder than the mortal death—
Adder-eyed Dusketha speak,
Shall we leave them and go seek
In the Earth’s wide Entrails old
Couches warm as their’s is cold?
O for a fiery gloom and thee,
Dusketha, so enchantingly
Freckle-wing’d and lizard-sided!

Dusketha.
By thee Spright will I be guided
I care not for cold or heat
Frost and Flame or sparks or sleet
To my essence are the same—
But I honour more the flame—
Spright of fire I follow thee
Wheresoever it may be;
To the torrid spouts and fountains,
Underneath earth-quaked mountains
Or at thy supreme desire,
Touch the very pulse of fire
With my bare unlidded eyes.

[Pg 254]Salam.
Sweet Dusketha! Paradise!
Off ye icy Spirits fly!
Frosty creatures of the Sky!

Dusketha.
Breathe upon them fiery Spright!

Zephyr, Breama (to each other).
Away Away to our delight!

Salam.
Go feed on icicles while we
Bedded in tongued-flames will be.

Dusketha.
Lead me to those fev’rous glooms,
Spright of fire—

Breama.
Me to the blooms
Blue-eyed Zephyr of those flowers
Far in the west where the May cloud lours;
And the beams of still Vesper, where winds are all whist
Are shed through the rain and the milder mist,
And twilight your floating bowers—

I have been reading lately two very different books, Robertson’s America and Voltaire’s Siècle de Louis XIV. It is like walking arm and arm between Pizarro and the great-little Monarch. In how lamentable a case do we see the great body of the people in both instances; in the first, where Men might seem to inherit quiet of Mind from unsophisticated senses; from uncontamination of civilisation, and especially from their being, as it were, estranged from the mutual helps of Society and its mutual injuries—and thereby more immediately under the Protection of Providence—even there they had mortal pains to bear as bad, or even worse than Bailiffs, Debts, and Poverties of civilised Life. The whole appears to resolve into this—that Man is originally a poor forked creature subject to the same mischances as the beasts of the forest, destined to hardships and disquietude of some[Pg 255] kind or other. If he improves by degrees his bodily accommodations and comforts—at each stage, at each ascent there are waiting for him a fresh set of annoyances—he is mortal, and there is still a heaven with its Stars above his head. The most interesting question that can come before us is, How far by the persevering endeavours of a seldom appearing Socrates Mankind may be made happy—I can imagine such happiness carried to an extreme, but what must it end in?—Death—and who could in such a case bear with death? The whole troubles of life, which are now frittered away in a series of years, would then be accumulated for the last days of a being who instead of hailing its approach would leave this world as Eve left Paradise. But in truth I do not at all believe in this sort of perfectibility—the nature of the world will not admit of it—the inhabitants of the world will correspond to itself. Let the fish Philosophise the ice away from the Rivers in winter time, and they shall be at continual play in the tepid delight of summer. Look at the Poles and at the Sands of Africa, whirlpools and volcanoes—Let men exterminate them and I will say that they may arrive at earthly Happiness. The point at which Man may arrive is as far as the parallel state in inanimate nature, and no further. For instance suppose a rose to have sensation, it blooms on a beautiful morning, it enjoys itself, but then comes a cold wind, a hot sun—it cannot escape it, it cannot destroy its annoyances—they are as native to the world as itself: no more can man be happy in spite, the worldly elements will prey upon his nature. The common cognomen of this world among the misguided and superstitious is “a vale of tears,” from which we are to be redeemed by a certain arbitrary interposition of God and taken to Heaven—What a little circumscribed straightened notion! Call the world if you please “The vale of Soul-making.” Then you will find out the use of the world (I am speaking now in the highest terms for human nature admitting it to be immortal which I will here take for granted for the[Pg 256] purpose of showing a thought which has struck me concerning it) I say ‘Soul-making’—Soul as distinguished from an Intelligence. There may be intelligences or sparks of the divinity in millions—but they are not Souls till they acquire identities, till each one is personally itself. Intelligences are atoms of perception—they know and they see and they are pure, in short they are God—how then are Souls to be made? How then are these sparks which are God to have identity given them—so as ever to possess a bliss peculiar to each one’s individual existence? How, but by the medium of a world like this? This point I sincerely wish to consider because I think it a grander system of salvation than the Christian religion—or rather it is a system of Spirit-creation—This is effected by three grand materials acting the one upon the other for a series of years—These three Materials are the Intelligence—the human heart (as distinguished from intelligence or Mind), and the World or Elemental space suited for the proper action of Mind and Heart on each other for the purpose of forming the Soul or Intelligence destined to possess the sense of Identity. I can scarcely express what I but dimly perceive—and yet I think I perceive it—that you may judge the more clearly I will put it in the most homely form possible. I will call the world a School instituted for the purpose of teaching little children to read—I will call the human heart the horn Book used in that School—and I will call the Child able to read, the Soul made from that School and its horn book. Do you not see how necessary a World of Pains and troubles is to school an Intelligence and make it a soul? A Place where the heart must feel and suffer in a thousand diverse ways. Not merely is the Heart a Hornbook, It is the Mind’s Bible, it is the Mind’s experience, it is the text from which the Mind or Intelligence sucks its identity. As various as the Lives of Men are—so various become their souls, and thus does God make individual beings, Souls, Identical Souls of the sparks of his own essence. This appears to me a faint[Pg 257] sketch of a system of Salvation which does not offend our reason and humanity—I am convinced that many difficulties which Christians labour under would vanish before it—there is one which even now strikes me—the salvation of Children. In them the spark or intelligence returns to God without any identity—it having had no time to learn of and be altered by the heart—or seat of the human Passions. It is pretty generally suspected that the Christian scheme has been copied from the ancient Persian and Greek Philosophers. Why may they not have made this simple thing even more simple for common apprehension by introducing Mediators and Personages, in the same manner as in the heathen mythology abstractions are personified? Seriously I think it probable that this system of Soul-making may have been the Parent of all the more palpable and personal schemes of Redemption among the Zoroastrians the Christians and the Hindoos. For as one part of the human species must have their carved Jupiter; so another part must have the palpable and named Mediator and Saviour, their Christ, their Oromanes, and their Vishnu. If what I have said should not be plain enough, as I fear it may not be, I will put you in the place where I began in this series of thoughts—I mean I began by seeing how man was formed by circumstances—and what are circumstances but touchstones of his heart? and what are touchstones but provings of his heart, but fortifiers or alterers of his nature? and what is his altered nature but his Soul?—and what was his Soul before it came into the world and had these provings and alterations and perfectionings?—An intelligence without Identity—and how is this Identity to be made? Through the medium of the Heart? and how is the heart to become this Medium but in a world of Circumstances?

There now I think what with Poetry and Theology, you may thank your stars that my pen is not very long-winded. Yesterday I received two Letters from your Mother and Henry, which I shall send by young Birkbeck with this.

[Pg 258]


Friday, April 30.

Brown has been here rummaging up some of my old sins—that is to say sonnets. I do not think you remember them, so I will copy them out, as well as two or three lately written. I have just written one on Fame—which Brown is transcribing and he has his book and mine. I must employ myself perhaps in a sonnet on the same subject—

ON FAME

You cannot eat your cake and have it too.—Proverb.

How fever’d is that Man who cannot look
Upon his mortal days with temperate blood
Who vexes all the leaves of his Life’s book
And robs his fair name of its maidenhood.
It is as if the rose should pluck herself
Or the ripe plum finger its misty bloom,
As if a clear Lake meddling with itself
Should cloud its clearness with a muddy gloom.
But the rose leaves herself upon the Briar
For winds to kiss and grateful Bees to feed,
And the ripe plum still wears its dim attire,
The undisturbed Lake has crystal space—
Why then should man, teasing the world for grace
Spoil his salvation by a fierce miscreed?


ANOTHER ON FAME

Fame like a wayward girl will still be coy
To those who woo her with too slavish knees
But makes surrender to some thoughtless boy
And dotes the more upon a heart at ease—
She is a Gipsy will not speak to those
Who have not learnt to be content without her,
A Jilt whose ear was never whisper’d close,
Who think they scandal her who talk about her—
A very Gipsy is she Nilus born,
Sister-in-law to jealous Potiphar—
Ye lovesick Bards, repay her scorn for scorn,
Ye lovelorn Artists, madmen that ye are,
Make your best bow to her and bid adieu,
Then if she likes it she will follow you.

[Pg 259]


TO SLEEP

O soft embalmer of the still midnight
Shutting with careful fingers and benign
Our gloom-pleased eyes embowered from the light
Enshaded in forgetfulness divine—
O soothest sleep, if so it please thee close
In midst of this thine hymn my willing eyes,
Or wait the amen, ere thy poppy throws
Around my bed its dewy Charities.
Then save me or the passed day will shine
Upon my pillow breeding many woes.
Save me from curious conscience that still lords
Its strength for darkness, burrowing like a Mole—
Turn the key deftly in the oiled wards,
And seal the hushed Casket of my soul.

The following Poem—the last I have written—is the first and the only one with which I have taken even moderate pains. I have for the most part dash’d off my lines in a hurry. This I have done leisurely—I think it reads the more richly for it, and will I hope encourage me to write other things in even a more peaceable and healthy spirit. You must recollect that Psyche was not embodied as a goddess before the time of Apuleius the Platonist who lived after the Augustan age, and consequently the Goddess was never worshipped or sacrificed to with any of the ancient fervour—and perhaps never thought of in the old religion—I am more orthodox than to let a heathen Goddess be so neglected—

ODE TO PSYCHE

O Goddess hear these tuneless numbers, wrung
By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear,
And pardon that thy secrets should be sung
Even into thine own soft-conched ear!
Surely I dreamt to-day; or did I see
The winged Psyche, with awaked eyes?
I wandered in a forest thoughtlessly,
And on the sudden, fainting with surprise,
Saw two fair Creatures couched side by side
[Pg 260]In deepest grass, beneath the whisp’ring fan
Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran
A Brooklet scarce espied
’Mid hush’d, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed,
Blue, freckle pink, and budded Syrian
They lay, calm-breathing on the bedded grass;
Their arms embraced and their pinions too;
Their lips touch’d not, but had not bid adieu,
As if disjoined by soft-handed slumber,
And ready still past kisses to outnumber
At tender dawn of aurorian love.
The winged boy I knew:
But who wast thou O happy happy dove?
His Psyche true?
O latest born, and loveliest vision far
Of all Olympus’ faded Hierarchy!
Fairer than Phœbe’s sapphire-region’d star,
Or Vesper amorous glow-worm of the sky;
Fairer than these though Temple thou hadst none,
Nor Altar heap’d with flowers;
Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan
Upon the midnight hours;
No voice, no lute, no pipe no incense sweet
From chain-swung Censer teeming—
No shrine, no grove, no Oracle, no heat
Of pale mouth’d Prophet dreaming!

O Bloomiest! though too late for antique vows;
Too, too late for the fond believing Lyre,
When holy were the haunted forest boughs,
Holy the Air, the water and the fire;
Yet even in these days so far retir’d
From happy Pieties, thy lucent fans,
Fluttering among the faint Olympians,
I see, and sing by my own eyes inspired.
O let me be thy Choir and make a moan
Upon the midnight hours;
Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet
From swinged Censer teeming;
Thy Shrine, thy Grove, thy Oracle, thy heat
Of pale-mouth’d Prophet dreaming!
Yes, I will be thy Priest and build a fane
In some untrodden region of my Mind,
Where branched thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain
Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind.
Far, far around shall those dark cluster’d trees
[Pg 261]Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep;
And there by Zephyrs streams and birds and bees
The moss-lain Dryads shall be lulled to sleep.
And in the midst of this wide-quietness
A rosy Sanctuary will I dress
With the wreath’d trellis of a working brain;
With buds and bells and stars without a name;
With all the gardener-fancy e’er could feign,
Who breeding flowers will never breed the same—
And there shall be for thee all soft delight
That shadowy thought can win;
A bright torch and a casement ope at night
To let the warm Love in.

Here endethe ye Ode to Psyche.
———
Incipit altera Sonneta
———

I have been endeavouring to discover a better Sonnet Stanza than we have. The legitimate does not suit the language over well from the pouncing rhymes—the other kind appears too elegiac—and the couplet at the end of it has seldom a pleasing effect—I do not pretend to have succeeded—it will explain itself.

If by dull rhymes our English must be chained,
And, like Andromeda, the sonnet sweet
Fetter’d, in spite of pained Loveliness;
Let us find out, if we must be constrain’d,
Sandals more interwoven and complete
To fit the naked foot of poesy;
Let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress
Of every chord, and see what may be gain’d
By ear industrious, and attention meet;
Misers of sound and syllable, no less
Than Midas of his coinage, let us be
Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown,
So, if we may not let the muse be free,
She will be bound with Garlands of her own.


[May 3.]

This is the third of May, and everything is in delightful forwardness; the violets are not withered before the peeping of the first rose. You must let me know [Pg 262]everything—how parcels go and come, what papers you have, and what newspapers you want, and other things. God bless you, my dear brother and sister.

Your ever affectionate Brother
John Keats.





XCIII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place. Saturday Morn.
[Postmark, February 27, 1819.]

My dear Fanny—I intended to have not failed to do as you requested, and write you as you say once a fortnight. On looking to your letter I find there is no date; and not knowing how long it is since I received it I do not precisely know how great a sinner I am. I am getting quite well, and Mrs. Dilke is getting on pretty well. You must pay no attention to Mrs. Abbey’s unfeeling and ignorant gabble. You can’t stop an old woman’s crying more than you can a Child’s. The old woman is the greatest nuisance because she is too old for the rod. Many people live opposite a Blacksmith’s till they cannot hear the hammer. I have been in Town for two or three days and came back last night. I have been a little concerned at not hearing from George—I continue in daily expectation. Keep on reading and play as much on the music and the grassplot as you can. I should like to take possession of those Grassplots for a Month or so; and send Mrs. A. to Town to count coffee berries instead of currant Bunches, for I want you to teach me a few common dancing steps—and I would buy a Watch box to practise them in by myself. I think I had better always pay the postage of these Letters. I shall send you another book the first time I am in Town early enough to book it with one of the morning Walthamstow Coaches. You did not say a word about your Chillblains. Write me directly and let me know about them—Your Letter shall be answered like an echo.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





[Pg 263]

XCIV.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, March 13 [1819].

My dear Fanny—I have been employed lately in writing to George—I do not send him very short letters, but keep on day after day. There were some young Men I think I told you of who were going to the Settlement: they have changed their minds, and I am disappointed in my expectation of sending Letters by them.—I went lately to the only dance I have been to these twelve months or shall go to for twelve months again—it was to our Brother in law’s cousin’s—She gave a dance for her Birthday and I went for the sake of Mrs. Wylie. I am waiting every day to hear from George—I trust there is no harm in the silence: other people are in the same expectation as we are. On looking at your seal I cannot tell whether it is done or not with a Tassie—it seems to me to be paste. As I went through Leicester Square lately I was going to call and buy you some, but not knowing but you might have some I would not run the chance of buying duplicates. Tell me if you have any or if you would like any—and whether you would rather have motto ones like that with which I seal this letter; or heads of great Men such as Shakspeare, Milton, etc.—or fancy pieces of Art; such as Fame, Adonis, etc.—those gentry you read of at the end of the English Dictionary. Tell me also if you want any particular Book; or Pencils, or drawing paper—anything but live stock. Though I will not now be very severe on it, remembering how fond I used to be of Goldfinches, Tomtits, Minnows, Mice, Ticklebacks, Dace, Cock salmons and all the whole tribe of the Bushes and the Brooks: but verily they are better in the Trees and the water—though I must confess even now a partiality for a handsome Globe of gold-fish—then I would have it hold 10 pails of water and be fed continually fresh through a cool pipe with another pipe to let through the floor—well ventilated they would preserve all their beautiful silver and Crimson. Then I would[Pg 264] put it before a handsome painted window and shade it all round with myrtles and Japonicas. I should like the window to open onto the Lake of Geneva—and there I’d sit and read all day like the picture of somebody reading. The weather now and then begins to feel like spring; and therefore I have begun my walks on the heath again. Mrs. Dilke is getting better than she has been as she has at length taken a Physician’s advice. She ever and anon asks after you and always bids me remember her in my Letters to you. She is going to leave Hampstead for the sake of educating their son Charles at the Westminster School. We (Mr. Brown and I) shall leave in the beginning of May; I do not know what I shall do or where be all the next summer. Mrs. Reynolds has had a sick house; but they are all well now. You see what news I can send you I do—we all live one day like the other as well as you do—the only difference is being sick and well—with the variations of single and double knocks, and the story of a dreadful fire in the Newspapers. I mentioned Mr. Brown’s name—yet I do not think I ever said a word about him to you. He is a friend of mine of two years’ standing, with whom I walked through Scotland: who has been very kind to me in many things when I most wanted his assistance and with whom I keep house till the first of May—you will know him some day. The name of the young Man who came with me is William Haslam.

Ever your affectionate Brother
John.





XCV.—TO FANNY KEATS.
[Postmark, Hampstead, March 24, 1819.]

My dear Fanny—It is impossible for me to call on you to-day—for I have particular Business at the other end of the Town this morning, and must be back to Hampstead with all speed to keep a long agreed on appointment. To-morrow I shall see you.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





[Pg 265]

XCVI.—TO JOSEPH SEVERN.
Wentworth Place, Monday Aft. [March 29? 1819].

My dear Severn—Your note gave me some pain, not on my own account, but on yours. Of course I should never suffer any petty vanity of mine to hinder you in any wise; and therefore I should say “put the miniature in the exhibition” if only myself was to be hurt. But, will it not hurt you? What good can it do to any future picture. Even a large picture is lost in that canting place—what a drop of water in the ocean is a Miniature. Those who might chance to see it for the most part if they had ever heard of either of us and know what we were and of what years would laugh at the puff of the one and the vanity of the other. I am however in these matters a very bad judge—and would advise you to act in a way that appears to yourself the best for your interest. As your “Hermia and Helena” is finished send that without the prologue of a Miniature. I shall see you soon, if you do not pay me a visit sooner—there’s a Bull for you.

Yours ever sincerely
John Keats.





XCVII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place [April 13, 1819].

My dear Fanny—I have been expecting a Letter from you about what the Parson said to your answers. I have thought also of writing to you often, and I am sorry to confess that my neglect of it has been but a small instance of my idleness of late—which has been growing upon me, so that it will require a great shake to get rid of it. I have written nothing and almost read nothing—but I must turn over a new leaf. One most discouraging thing hinders me—we have no news yet from George—so that I cannot with any confidence continue the Letter I have been preparing for him. Many are in the[Pg 266] same state with us and many have heard from the Settlement. They must be well however: and we must consider this silence as good news. I ordered some bulbous roots for you at the Gardener’s, and they sent me some, but they were all in bud—and could not be sent—so I put them in our Garden. There are some beautiful heaths now in bloom in Pots—either heaths or some seasonable plants I will send you instead—perhaps some that are not yet in bloom that you may see them come out. To-morrow night I am going to a rout, a thing I am not at all in love with. Mr. Dilke and his Family have left Hampstead—I shall dine with them to-day in Westminster where I think I told you they were going to reside for the sake of sending their son Charles to the Westminster School. I think I mentioned the Death of Mr. Haslam’s Father. Yesterday week the two Mr. Wylies dined with me. I hope you have good store of double violets—I think they are the Princesses of flowers, and in a shower of rain, almost as fine as barley sugar drops are to a schoolboy’s tongue. I suppose this fine weather the lambs’ tails give a frisk or two extraordinary—when a boy would cry huzza and a Girl O my! a little Lamb frisks its tail. I have not been lately through Leicester Square—the first time I do I will remember your Seals. I have thought it best to live in Town this Summer, chiefly for the sake of books, which cannot be had with any comfort in the Country—besides my Scotch journey gave me a dose of the Picturesque with which I ought to be contented for some time. Westminster is the place I have pitched upon—the City or any place very confined would soon turn me pale and thin—which is to be avoided. You must make up your mind to get stout this summer—indeed I have an idea we shall both be corpulent old folks with triple chins and stumpy thumbs.

Your affectionate Brother
John.





[Pg 267]

XCVIII.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
Tuesday [April 13, 1819].

My dear Haydon—When I offered you assistance I thought I had it in my hand; I thought I had nothing to do but to do. The difficulties I met with arose from the alertness and suspicion of Abbey: and especially from the affairs being still in a Lawyer’s hand—who has been draining our Property for the last six years of every charge he could make. I cannot do two things at once, and thus this affair has stopped my pursuits in every way—from the first prospect I had of difficulty. I assure you I have harassed myself ten times more than if I alone had been concerned in so much gain or loss. I have also ever told you the exact particulars as well as and as literally as any hopes or fear could translate them: for it was only by parcels that I found all those petty obstacles which for my own sake should not exist a moment—and yet why not—for from my own imprudence and neglect all my accounts are entirely in my Guardian’s Power. This has taught me a Lesson. Hereafter I will be more correct. I find myself possessed of much less than I thought for and now if I had all on the table all I could do would be to take from it a moderate two years’ subsistence and lend you the rest; but I cannot say how soon I could become possessed of it. This would be no sacrifice nor any matter worth thinking of—much less than parting as I have more than once done with little sums which might have gradually formed a library to my taste. These sums amount together to nearly £200, which I have but a chance of ever being repaid or paid at a very distant period. I am humble enough to put this in writing from the sense I have of your struggling situation and the great desire that you should do me the justice to credit me the unostentatious and willing state of my nerves on all such occasions. It has not been my fault. I am doubly hurt at[Pg 268] the slightly reproachful tone of your note and at the occasion of it,—for it must be some other disappointment; you seem’d so sure of some important help when I last saw you—now you have maimed me again; I was whole, I had began reading again—when your note came I was engaged in a Book. I dread as much as a Plague the idle fever of two months more without any fruit. I will walk over the first fine day: then see what aspect your affairs have taken, and if they should continue gloomy walk into the City to Abbey and get his consent for I am persuaded that to me alone he will not concede a jot.





XCIX.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, Saturday.
[April 17, 1819?]

My dear Fanny—If it were but six o’Clock in the morning I would set off to see you to-day: if I should do so now I could not stop long enough for a how d’ye do—it is so long a walk through Hornsey and Tottenham—and as for Stage Coaching it besides that it is very expensive it is like going into the Boxes by way of the pit. I cannot go out on Sunday—but if on Monday it should promise as fair as to-day I will put on a pair of loose easy palatable boots and me rendre chez vous. I continue increasing my letter to George to send it by one of Birkbeck’s sons who is going out soon—so if you will let me have a few more lines, they will be in time. I am glad you got on so well with Monsr. le Curé. Is he a nice clergyman?—a great deal depends upon a cock’d hat and powder—not gunpowder, lord love us, but lady-meal, violet-smooth, dainty-scented, lilly-white, feather-soft, wigsby-dressing, coat-collar-spoiling, whisker-reaching, pig-tail-loving, swans-down-puffing, parson-sweetening powder. I shall call in passing at the Tottenham nursery and see if I can find some seasonable plants for you. That is the nearest place—or by our la’kin or lady kin,[Pg 269] that is by the virgin Mary’s kindred, is there not a twig-manufacturer in Walthamstow? Mr. and Mrs. Dilke are coming to dine with us to-day. They will enjoy the country after Westminster. O there is nothing like fine weather, and health, and Books, and a fine country, and a contented Mind, and diligent habit of reading and thinking, and an amulet against the ennui—and, please heaven, a little claret wine cool out of a cellar a mile deep—with a few or a good many ratafia cakes—a rocky basin to bathe in, a strawberry bed to say your prayers to Flora in, a pad nag to go you ten miles or so; two or three sensible people to chat with; two or three spiteful folks to spar with; two or three odd fishes to laugh at and two or three numskulls to argue with—instead of using dumb bells on a rainy day—

Two or three Posies
With two or three simples—
Two or three Noses
With two or three pimples—
Two or three wise men
And two or three ninny’s—
Two or three purses
And two or three guineas—
Two or three raps
At two or three doors—
Two or three naps
Of two or three hours—
Two or three Cats
And two or three mice—
Two or three sprats
At a very great price—
Two or three sandies
And two or three tabbies—
Two or three dandies
And two Mrs.—— mum
Two or three Smiles
And two or three frowns—
Two or three Miles
To two or three towns—
Two or three pegs
For two or three bonnets—
Two or three dove eggs
[Pg 270]To hatch into sonnets—
Good-bye I’ve an appointment—can’t
stop pon word—good-bye—now
don’t get up—open the door my-
self—good-bye—see ye Monday.

J. K.





C.—TO FANNY KEATS.
[Hampstead, May 13, 1819.]

My dear Fanny—I have a Letter from George at last—and it contains, considering all things, good news—I have been with it to-day to Mrs. Wylie’s, with whom I have left it. I shall have it again as soon as possible and then I will walk over and read it to you. They are quite well and settled tolerably in comfort after a great deal of fatigue and harass. They had the good chance to meet at Louisville with a Schoolfellow of ours. You may expect me within three days. I am writing to-night several notes concerning this to many of my friends. Good-night! God bless you.

John Keats.





CI.—TO FANNY KEATS.
[Hampstead, May 26, 1819.]

My dear Fanny—I have been looking for a fine day to pass at Walthamstow: there has not been one Morning (except Sunday and then I was obliged to stay at home) that I could depend upon. I have I am sorry to say had an accident with the Letter—I sent it to Haslam and he returned it torn into a thousand pieces. So I shall be obliged to tell you all I can remember from Memory. You would have heard from me before this but that I was in continual expectation of a fine Morning—I want also to speak to you concerning myself. Mind I do not purpose to quit England, as George has done; but I am afraid I shall be forced to take a voyage or two. However we will not think of that for some[Pg 271] Months. Should it be a fine morning to-morrow you will see me.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





CII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place [June 9, 1819].

My dear Fanny—I shall be with you next Monday at the farthest. I could not keep my promise of seeing you again in a week because I am in so unsettled a state of mind about what I am to do—I have given up the Idea of the Indiaman; I cannot resolve to give up my favorite studies: so I purpose to retire into the Country and set my Mind at work once more. A Friend of Mine who has an ill state of health called on me yesterday and proposed to spend a little time with him at the back of the Isle of Wight where he said we might live very cheaply. I agreed to his proposal. I have taken a great dislike to Town—I never go there—some one is always calling on me and as we have spare beds they often stop a couple of days. I have written lately to some acquaintances in Devonshire concerning a cheap Lodging and they have been very kind in letting me know all I wanted. They have described a pleasant place which I think I shall eventually retire to. How came you on with my young Master Yorkshire Man? Did not Mrs. A. sport her Carriage and one? They really surprised me with super civility—how did Mrs. A. manage it? How is the old tadpole gardener and little Master next door? it is to be hop’d they will both die some of these days. Not having been to Town I have not heard whether Mr. A. purposes to retire from business. Do let me know if you have heard anything more about it. If he should not I shall be very disappointed. If any one deserves to be put to his shifts it is that Hodgkinson—as for the other he would live a long time upon his fat and be none the worse for a good long lent. How came miledi to give one Lisbon wine—had she drained the Gooseberry?[Pg 272] Truly I cannot delay making another visit—asked to take Lunch, whether I will have ale, wine, take sugar,—objection to green—like cream—thin bread and butter—another cup—agreeable—enough sugar—little more cream—too weak—12 shillin etc. etc. etc.—Lord I must come again. We are just going to Dinner I must must[101] with this to the Post——

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





CIII.—TO JAMES ELMES.
Wentworth Place, Hampstead [June 12, 1819].

Sir—I did not see your Note till this Saturday evening, or I should have answered it sooner—However as it happens I have but just received the Book which contains the only copy of the verses in question.[102] I have asked for it repeatedly ever since I promised Mr. Haydon and could not help the delay; which I regret. The verses can be struck out in no time, and will I hope be quite in time. If you think it at all necessary a proof may be forwarded; but as I shall transcribe it fairly perhaps there may be no need.

I am, Sir, your obedt Servt
John Keats.





CIV.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, [June 14, 1819].

My dear Fanny—I cannot be with you to-day for two reasons—1ly I have my sore-throat coming again to prevent my walking. 2ly I do not happen just at present to be flush of silver so that I might ride. To-morrow I am engaged—but the day after you shall see me. Mr. Brown is waiting for me as we are going to Town together, so good-bye.

Your affectionate Brother
John.





[Pg 273]

CV.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place [June 16, 1819].

My dear Fanny—Still I cannot afford to spend money by Coachhire and still my throat is not well enough to warrant my walking. I went yesterday to ask Mr. Abbey for some money; but I could not on account of a Letter he showed me from my Aunt’s solicitor. You do not understand the business. I trust it will not in the end be detrimental to you. I am going to try the Press once more, and to that end shall retire to live cheaply in the country and compose myself and verses as well as I can. I have very good friends ready to help me—and I am the more bound to be careful of the money they lend me. It will all be well in the course of a year I hope. I am confident of it, so do not let it trouble you at all. Mr. Abbey showed me a Letter he had received from George containing the news of the birth of a Niece for us—and all doing well—he said he would take it to you—so I suppose to-day you will see it. I was preparing to enquire for a situation with an apothecary, but Mr. Brown persuades me to try the press once more; so I will with all my industry and ability. Mr. Rice a friend of mine in ill health has proposed retiring to the back of the Isle of Wight—which I hope will be cheap in the summer—I am sure it will in the winter. Thence you shall frequently hear from me and in the Letters I will copy those lines I may write which will be most pleasing to you in the confidence you will show them to no one. I have not run quite aground yet I hope, having written this morning to several people to whom I have lent money requesting repayment. I shall henceforth shake off my indolent fits, and among other reformation be more diligent in writing to you, and mind you always answer me. I shall be obliged to go out of town on Saturday and shall have no money till to-morrow, so I am very sorry to think I shall not be able to come to [Pg 274]Walthamstow. The Head Mr. Severn did of me is now too dear, but here inclosed is a very capital Profile done by Mr. Brown. I will write again on Monday or Tuesday—Mr. and Mrs. Dilke are well.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





CVI.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
Wentworth Place.
Thursday Morning [June 17, 1819].

My dear Haydon—I know you will not be prepared for this, because your Pocket must needs be very low having been at ebb tide so long: but what can I do? mine is lower. I was the day before yesterday much in want of Money: but some news I had yesterday has driven me into necessity. I went to Abbey’s for some Cash, and he put into my hand a letter from my Aunt’s Solicitor containing the pleasant information that she was about to file a Bill in Chancery against us. Now in case of a defeat Abbey will be very undeservedly in the wrong box; so I could not ask him for any more money, nor can I till the affair is decided; and if it goes against him I must in conscience make over to him what little he may have remaining. My purpose is now to make one more attempt in the Press—if that fail, “ye hear no more of me” as Chaucer says. Brown has lent me some money for the present. Do borrow or beg somehow what you can for me. Do not suppose I am at all uncomfortable about the matter in any other way than as it forces me to apply to the needy. I could not send you those lines, for I could not get the only copy of them before last Saturday evening. I sent them Mr. Elmes on Monday. I saw Monkhouse on Sunday—he told me you were getting on with the Picture. I would have come over to you to-day, but I am fully employed.

Yours ever sincerely
John Keats.





[Pg 275]

CVII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Shanklin, Isle of Wight, Tuesday, July 6.

My dear Fanny—I have just received another Letter from George—full of as good news as we can expect. I cannot inclose it to you as I could wish because it contains matters of Business to which I must for a Week to come have an immediate reference. I think I told you the purpose for which I retired to this place—to try the fortune of my Pen once more, and indeed I have some confidence in my success: but in every event, believe me my dear sister, I shall be sufficiently comfortable, as, if I cannot lead that life of competence and society I should wish, I have enough knowledge of my gallipots to ensure me an employment and maintenance. The Place I am in now I visited once before and a very pretty place it is were it not for the bad weather. Our window looks over house-tops and Cliffs onto the Sea, so that when the Ships sail past the Cottage chimneys you may take them for weathercocks. We have Hill and Dale, forest and Mead, and plenty of Lobsters. I was on the Portsmouth Coach the Sunday before last in that heavy shower—and I may say I went to Portsmouth by water—I got a little cold, and as it always flies to my throat I am a little out of sorts that way. There were on the Coach with me some common French people but very well behaved—there was a woman amongst them to whom the poor Men in ragged coats were more gallant than ever I saw gentleman to Lady at a Ball. When we got down to walk up hill—one of them pick’d a rose, and on remounting gave it to the woman with “Ma’mselle voila une belle rose!” I am so hard at work that perhaps I should not have written to you for a day or two if George’s Letter had not diverted my attention to the interests and pleasure of those I love—and ever believe that when I do not behave punctually it is from a very necessary occupation, and that my silence is no[Pg 276] proof of my not thinking of you, or that I want more than a gentle fillip to bring your image with every claim before me. You have never seen mountains, or I might tell you that the hill at Steephill is I think almost of as much consequence as Mount Rydal on Lake Winander. Bonchurch too is a very delightful Place—as I can see by the Cottages, all romantic—covered with creepers and honeysuckles, with roses and eglantines peeping in at the windows. Fit abodes for the People I guess live in them, romantic old maids fond of novels, or soldiers’ widows with a pretty jointure—or any body’s widows or aunts or anythings given to Poetry and a Piano-forte—as far as in ’em lies—as people say. If I could play upon the Guitar I might make my fortune with an old song—and get two blessings at once—a Lady’s heart and the Rheumatism. But I am almost afraid to peep at those little windows—for a pretty window should show a pretty face, and as the world goes chances are against me. I am living with a very good fellow indeed, a Mr. Rice.—He is unfortunately labouring under a complaint which has for some years been a burthen to him. This is a pain to me. He has a greater tact in speaking to people of the village than I have, and in those matters is a great amusement as well as good friend to me. He bought a ham the other day for says he “Keats, I don’t think a Ham is a wrong thing to have in a house.” Write to me, Shanklin, Isle of Wight, as soon as you can; for a Letter is a great treat to me here—believing me ever,

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





CVIII.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
Extract from a letter dated Shanklin, nr Ryde, Isle of Wight,
Sunday, 12th [for 11th] July, 1819.

········

You will be glad to hear, under my own hand (though Rice says we are like Sauntering Jack and Idle Joe),[Pg 277] how diligent I have been, and am being. I have finished the Act, and in the interval of beginning the 2d have proceeded pretty well with Lamia, finishing the 1st part which consists of about 400 lines. I have great hopes of success, because I make use of my Judgment more deliberately than I have yet done; but in case of failure with the world, I shall find my content. And here (as I know you have my good at heart as much as a Brother), I can only repeat to you what I have said to George—that however I should like to enjoy what the competencies of life procure, I am in no wise dashed at a different prospect. I have spent too many thoughtful days and moralised through too many nights for that, and fruitless would they be indeed, if they did not by degrees make me look upon the affairs of the world with a healthy deliberation. I have of late been moulting: not for fresh feathers and wings: they are gone, and in their stead I hope to have a pair of patient sublunary legs. I have altered, not from a Chrysalis into a butterfly, but the contrary; having two little loopholes, whence I may look out into the stage of the world: and that world on our coming here I almost forgot. The first time I sat down to write, I could scarcely believe in the necessity for so doing. It struck me as a great oddity—Yet the very corn which is now so beautiful, as if it had only took to ripening yesterday, is for the market; so, why should I be delicate?

········





CIX.—TO CHARLES WENTWORTH DILKE.
Shanklin, Saturday Evening [July 31, 1819].

My dear Dilke—I will not make my diligence an excuse for not writing to you sooner—because I consider idleness a much better plea. A Man in the hurry of business of any sort is expected and ought to be expected to look to everything—his mind is in a whirl, and what matters it what whirl? But to require a Letter of a[Pg 278] Man lost in idleness is the utmost cruelty; you cut the thread of his existence, you beat, you pummel him, you sell his goods and chattels, you put him in prison; you impale him; you crucify him. If I had not put pen to paper since I saw you this would be to me a vi et armis taking up before the Judge; but having got over my darling lounging habits a little, it is with scarcely any pain I come to this dating from Shanklin and Dear Dilke. The Isle of Wight is but so so, etc. Rice and I passed rather a dull time of it. I hope he will not repent coming with me. He was unwell, and I was not in very good health: and I am afraid we made each other worse by acting upon each other’s spirits. We would grow as melancholy as need be. I confess I cannot bear a sick person in a House, especially alone—it weighs upon me day and night—and more so when perhaps the Case is irretrievable. Indeed I think Rice is in a dangerous state. I have had a Letter from him which speaks favourably of his health at present. Brown and I are pretty well harnessed again to our dog-cart. I mean the Tragedy, which goes on sinkingly. We are thinking of introducing an Elephant, but have not historical reference within reach to determine us as to Otho’s Menagerie. When Brown first mentioned this I took it for a joke; however he brings such plausible reasons, and discourses so eloquently on the dramatic effect that I am giving it a serious consideration. The Art of Poetry is not sufficient for us, and if we get on in that as well as we do in painting, we shall by next winter crush the Reviews and the Royal Academy. Indeed, if Brown would take a little of my advice, he could not fail to be first palette of his day. But odd as it may appear, he says plainly that he cannot see any force in my plea of putting skies in the background, and leaving Indian ink out of an ash tree. The other day he was sketching Shanklin Church, and as I saw how the business was going on, I challenged him to a trial of skill—he lent me Pencil and Paper—we keep the Sketches to contend for the Prize at the[Pg 279] Gallery. I will not say whose I think best—but really I do not think Brown’s done to the top of the Art.

A word or two on the Isle of Wight. I have been no further than Steephill. If I may guess, I should say that there is no finer part in the Island than from this Place to Steephill. I do not hesitate to say it is fine. Bonchurch is the best. But I have been so many finer walks, with a background of lake and mountain instead of the sea, that I am not much touch’d with it, though I credit it for all the Surprise I should have felt if it had taken my cockney maidenhead. But I may call myself an old Stager in the picturesque, and unless it be something very large and overpowering, I cannot receive any extraordinary relish.

I am sorry to hear that Charles is so much oppress’d at Westminster, though I am sure it will be the finest touchstone for his Metal in the world. His troubles will grow day by day less, as his age and strength increase. The very first Battle he wins will lift him from the Tribe of Manasseh. I do not know how I should feel were I a Father—but I hope I should strive with all my Power not to let the present trouble me. When your Boy shall be twenty, ask him about his childish troubles and he will have no more memory of them than you have of yours. Brown tells me Mrs. Dilke sets off to-day for Chichester. I am glad—I was going to say she had a fine day—but there has been a great Thunder cloud muttering over Hampshire all day—I hope she is now at supper with a good appetite.

So Reynolds’s Piece succeeded—that is all well. Papers have with thanks been duly received. We leave this place on the 13th, and will let you know where we may be a few days after—Brown says he will write when the fit comes on him. If you will stand law expenses I’ll beat him into one before his time. When I come to town I shall have a little talk with you about Brown and one Jenny Jacobs. Open daylight! he don’t care. I am afraid there will be some more feet for little [Pg 280]stockings—[of Keats’s making. (I mean the feet.)[103]] Brown here tried at a piece of Wit but it failed him, as you see, though long a brewing.—[this is a 2d lie.] Men should never despair—you see he has tried again and succeeded to a miracle.—He wants to try again, but as I have a right to an inside place in my own Letter—I take possession.

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





CX.—TO BENJAMIN BAILEY.
[Fragment (outside sheet) of a letter addressed to Bailey at St.
Andrews. Winchester, August 15, 1819.]

········

We removed to Winchester for the convenience of a library, and find it an exceeding pleasant town, enriched with a beautiful Cathedral, and surrounded by a fresh-looking country. We are in tolerably good and cheap lodgings—Within these two months I have written 1500 lines, most of which, besides many more of prior composition, you will probably see by next winter. I have written 2 tales, one from Boccaccio, called the Pot of Basil, and another called St. Agnes’s Eve, on a popular Superstition, and a 3rd called Lamia (half finished). I have also been writing parts of my “Hyperion,” and completed 4 Acts of a tragedy. It was the opinion of most of my friends that I should never be able to write a scene. I will endeavour to wipe away the prejudice—I sincerely hope you will be pleased when my labours, since we last saw each other, shall reach you. One of my Ambitions is to make as great a revolution in modern dramatic writing as Kean has done in acting. Another to upset the drawling of the blue-stocking literary world—if in the Course of a few years I do these two things, I ought to die content, and my friends should drink a dozen of claret on my tomb. I am convinced more and more every day that (excepting[Pg 281] the human friend philosopher), a fine writer is the most genuine being in the world. Shakspeare and the Paradise lost every day become greater wonders to me. I look upon fine phrases like a lover. I was glad to see by a passage of one of Brown’s letters, some time ago, from the North that you were in such good spirits. Since that you have been married, and in congratulating you I wish you every continuance of them. Present my respects to Mrs. Bailey. This sounds oddly to me, and I daresay I do it awkwardly enough: but I suppose by this time it is nothing new to you. Brown’s remembrances to you. As far as I know, we shall remain at Winchester for a goodish while.

Ever your sincere friend
John Keats.





CXI.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
Winchester, Monday morn [August 23, 1819].

My dear Taylor— ... Brown and I have together been engaged (this I should wish to remain secret) on a Tragedy which I have just finished and from which we hope to share moderate profits.... I feel every confidence that, if I choose, I may be a popular writer. That I will never be; but for all that I will get a livelihood. I equally dislike the favour of the public with the love of a woman. They are both a cloying treacle to the wings of Independence. I shall ever consider them (People) as debtors to me for verses, not myself to them for admiration—which I can do without. I have of late been indulging my spleen by composing a preface at them: after all resolving never to write a preface at all. “There are so many verses,” would I have said to them, “give so much means for me to buy pleasure with, as a relief to my hours of labour”—You will observe at the end of this if you put down the letter, “How a solitary life engenders pride and egotism!” True—I know it does: but this pride and egotism will enable me to write finer things than anything else could—so I will indulge it. Just so much[Pg 282] as I am humbled by the genius above my grasp am I exalted and look with hate and contempt upon the literary world.—A drummer-boy who holds out his hand familiarly to a field Marshal,—that drummer-boy with me is the good word and favour of the public. Who could wish to be among the common-place crowd of the little famous—who are each individually lost in a throng made up of themselves? Is this worth louting or playing the hypocrite for? To beg suffrages for a seat on the benches of a myriad-aristocracy in letters? This is not wise.—I am not a wise man—’Tis pride—I will give you a definition of a proud man—He is a man who has neither Vanity nor Wisdom—One filled with hatreds cannot be vain, neither can he be wise. Pardon me for hammering instead of writing. Remember me to Woodhouse Hessey and all in Percy Street.

Ever yours sincerely
John Keats.





CXII.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
Winchester, August 25 [1819].

My dear Reynolds—By this post I write to Rice, who will tell you why we have left Shanklin; and how we like this place. I have indeed scarcely anything else to say, leading so monotonous a life, except I was to give you a history of sensations, and day-nightmares. You would not find me at all unhappy in it, as all my thoughts and feelings which are of the selfish nature, home speculations, every day continue to make me more iron—I am convinced more and more, every day, that fine writing is, next to fine doing, the top thing in the world; the Paradise Lost becomes a greater wonder. The more I know what my diligence may in time probably effect, the more does my heart distend with Pride and Obstinacy—I feel it in my power to become a popular writer—I feel it in my power to refuse the poisonous suffrage of a public. My own being which I know to be becomes of more consequence to me than the crowds of Shadows[Pg 283] in the shape of men and women that inhabit a kingdom. The soul is a world of itself, and has enough to do in its own home. Those whom I know already, and who have grown as it were a part of myself, I could not do without: but for the rest of mankind, they are as much a dream to me as Milton’s Hierarchies. I think if I had a free and healthy and lasting organisation of heart, and lungs as strong as an ox’s so as to be able to bear unhurt the shock of extreme thought and sensation without weariness, I could pass my life very nearly alone though it should last eighty years. But I feel my body too weak to support me to the height, I am obliged continually to check myself, and be nothing. It would be vain for me to endeavour after a more reasonable manner of writing to you. I have nothing to speak of but myself, and what can I say but what I feel? If you should have any reason to regret this state of excitement in me, I will turn the tide of your feelings in the right Channel, by mentioning that it is the only state for the best sort of Poetry—that is all I care for, all I live for. Forgive me for not filling up the whole sheet; Letters become so irksome to me, that the next time I leave London I shall petition them all to be spared me. To give me credit for constancy, and at the same time waive letter writing will be the highest indulgence I can think of.

Ever your affectionate friend
John Keats.





CXIII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Winchester, August 28 [1819].

My dear Fanny—You must forgive me for suffering so long a space to elapse between the dates of my letters. It is more than a fortnight since I left Shanklin chiefly for the purpose of being near a tolerable Library, which after all is not to be found in this place. However we like it very much: it is the pleasantest Town I ever was in, and has the most recommendations of any. There is a fine Cathedral which to me is always a source of[Pg 284] amusement, part of it built 1400 years ago; and the more modern by a magnificent Man, you may have read of in our History, called William of Wickham. The whole town is beautifully wooded. From the Hill at the eastern extremity you see a prospect of Streets, and old Buildings mixed up with Trees. Then there are the most beautiful streams about I ever saw—full of Trout. There is the Foundation of St. Croix about half a mile in the fields—a charity greatly abused. We have a Collegiate School, a Roman catholic School; a chapel ditto and a Nunnery! And what improves it all is, the fashionable inhabitants are all gone to Southampton. We are quiet—except a fiddle that now and then goes like a gimlet through my Ears—our Landlady’s son not being quite a Proficient. I have still been hard at work, having completed a Tragedy I think I spoke of to you. But there I fear all my labour will be thrown away for the present, as I hear Mr. Kean is going to America. For all I can guess I shall remain here till the middle of October—when Mr. Brown will return to his house at Hampstead; whither I shall return with him. I some time since sent the Letter I told you I had received from George to Haslam with a request to let you and Mrs. Wylie see it: he sent it back to me for very insufficient reasons without doing so; and I was so irritated by it that I would not send it travelling about by the post any more: besides the postage is very expensive. I know Mrs. Wylie will think this a great neglect. I am sorry to say my temper gets the better of me—I will not send it again. Some correspondence I have had with Mr. Abbey about George’s affairs—and I must confess he has behaved very kindly to me as far as the wording of his Letter went. Have you heard any further mention of his retiring from Business? I am anxious to hear whether Hodgkinson, whose name I cannot bear to write, will in any likelihood be thrown upon himself. The delightful Weather we have had for two Months is the highest gratification I could receive—no[Pg 285] chill’d red noses—no shivering—but fair atmosphere to think in—a clean towel mark’d with the mangle and a basin of clear Water to drench one’s face with ten times a day: no need of much exercise—a Mile a day being quite sufficient. My greatest regret is that I have not been well enough to bathe though I have been two Months by the seaside and live now close to delicious bathing—Still I enjoy the Weather—I adore fine Weather as the greatest blessing I can have. Give me Books, fruit, French wine and fine weather and a little music out of doors, played by somebody I do not know—not pay the price of one’s time for a jig—but a little chance music: and I can pass a summer very quietly without caring much about Fat Louis, fat Regent or the Duke of Wellington. Why have you not written to me? Because you were in expectation of George’s Letter and so waited? Mr. Brown is copying out our Tragedy of Otho the Great in a superb style—better than it deserves—there as I said is labour in vain for the present. I had hoped to give Kean another opportunity to shine. What can we do now? There is not another actor of Tragedy in all London or Europe. The Covent Garden Company is execrable. Young is the best among them and he is a ranting coxcombical tasteless Actor—a Disgust, a Nausea—and yet the very best after Kean. What a set of barren asses are actors! I should like now to promenade round your Gardens—apple-tasting—pear-tasting—plum-judging—apricot-nibbling—peach-scrunching—nectarine-sucking and Melon-carving. I have also a great feeling for antiquated cherries full of sugar cracks—and a white currant tree kept for company. I admire lolling on a lawn by a water lilied pond to eat white currants and see gold-fish: and go to the Fair in the Evening if I’m good. There is not hope for that—one is sure to get into some mess before evening. Have these hot days I brag of so much been well or ill for your health? Let me hear soon.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





[Pg 286]

CXIV.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
Winchester, September 1, 1819.

My dear Taylor—Brown and I have been employed for these 3 weeks past from time to time in writing to our different friends—a dead silence is our only answer—we wait morning after morning. Tuesday is the day for the Examiner to arrive, this is the 2d Tuesday which has been barren even of a newspaper—Men should be in imitation of spirits “responsive to each other’s note.” Instead of that I pipe and no one hath danced. We have been cursing like Mandeville and Lisle—With this I shall send by the same post a 3d letter to a friend of mine, who though it is of consequence has neither answered right or left. We have been much in want of news from the Theatres, having heard that Kean is going to America—but no—not a word. Why I should come on you with all these complaints I cannot explain to myself, especially as I suspect you must be in the country. Do answer me soon for I really must know something. I must steer myself by the rudder of Information....

Ever yours sincerely
John Keats.





CXV.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
Winchester, September 5 [1819].

My dear Taylor—This morning I received yours of the 2d, and with it a letter from Hessey enclosing a Bank post Bill of £30, an ample sum I assure you—more I had no thought of.—You should not have delayed so long in Fleet St.—leading an inactive life as you did was breathing poison: you will find the country air do more for you than you expect. But it must be proper country air. You must choose a spot. What sort of a place is Retford? You should have a dry, gravelly, barren, elevated country, open to the currents of air, and such a place is generally furnished with the finest springs—The neighbourhood[Pg 287] of a rich enclosed fulsome manured arable land, especially in a valley and almost as bad on a flat, would be almost as bad as the smoke of Fleet St.—Such a place as this was Shanklin, only open to the south-east, and surrounded by hills in every other direction. From this south-east came the damps of the sea; which, having no egress, the air would for days together take on an unhealthy idiosyncrasy altogether enervating and weakening as a city smoke—I felt it very much. Since I have been here at Winchester I have been improving in health—it is not so confined—and there is on one side of the City a dry chalky down, where the air is worth Sixpence a pint. So if you do not get better at Retford, do not impute it to your own weakness before you have well considered the Nature of the air and soil—especially as Autumn is encroaching—for the Autumn fog over a rich land is like the steam from cabbage water. What makes the great difference between valesmen, flatlandmen and mountaineers? The cultivation of the earth in a great measure—Our health temperament and disposition are taken more (notwithstanding the contradiction of the history of Cain and Abel) from the air we breathe, than is generally imagined. See the difference between a Peasant and a Butcher.—I am convinced a great cause of it is the difference of the air they breathe: the one takes his mingled with the fume of slaughter, the other from the dank exhalement from the glebe; the teeming damp that comes up from the plough-furrow is of great effect in taming the fierceness of a strong man—more than his labour—Let him be mowing furze upon a mountain, and at the day’s end his thoughts will run upon a..axe[104] if he ever had handled one; let him leave the plough, and he will think quietly of his supper. Agriculture is the tamer of men—the steam from the earth is like drinking their Mother’s milk—it enervates their nature—this appears a great cause of the imbecility of the Chinese: and if this sort of atmosphere is a mitigation to the energy[Pg 288] of a strong man, how much more must it injure a weak one unoccupied unexercised—For what is the cause of so many men maintaining a good state in Cities, but occupation—An idle man, a man who is not sensitively alive to self-interest in a city cannot continue long in good health. This is easily explained—If you were to walk leisurely through an unwholesome path in the fens, with a little horror of them, you would be sure to have your ague. But let Macbeth cross the same path, with the dagger in the air leading him on, and he would never have an ague or anything like it—You should give these things a serious consideration. Notts, I believe, is a flat county—You should be on the slope of one of the dry barren hills in Somersetshire. I am convinced there is as harmful air to be breathed in the country as in town. I am greatly obliged to you for your letter. Perhaps, if you had had strength and spirits enough, you would have felt offended by my offering a note of hand, or rather expressed it. However, I am sure you will give me credit for not in anywise mistrusting you: or imagining that you would take advantage of any power I might give you over me. No—It proceeded from my serious resolve not to be a gratuitous borrower, from a great desire to be correct in money matters, to have in my desk the Chronicles of them to refer to, and know my worldly non-estate: besides in case of my death such documents would be but just, if merely as memorials of the friendly turns I had done to me—Had I known of your illness I should not have written in such fiery phrase in my first letter. I hope that shortly you will be able to bear six times as much. Brown likes the tragedy very much: But he is not a fit judge of it, as I have only acted as midwife to his plot; and of course he will be fond of his child. I do not think I can make you any extracts without spoiling the effect of the whole when you come to read it—I hope you will then not think my labour mis-spent. Since I finished it, I have finished Lamia, and am now occupied in revising St. Agnes’s Eve, and studying[Pg 289] Italian. Ariosto I find as diffuse, in parts, as Spenser—I understand completely the difference between them. I will cross the letter with some lines from Lamia. Brown’s kindest remembrances to you—and I am ever your most sincere friend

John Keats.

A haunting Music sole perhaps and lone
Supportress of the fairy roof made moan
Throughout as fearful the whole charm might fade.
Fresh Carved Cedar mimicking a glade
Of Palm and Plantain met from either side
In the high midst in honour of the Bride—
Two Palms, and then two plantains and so on
From either side their stems branch’d one to one
All down the aisled place—and beneath all
There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall.
So canopied lay an untasted feast
Teeming a perfume. Lamia regal drest
Silverly paced about and as she went
Mission’d her viewless servants to enrich
The splendid finish of each nook and niche—
Between the tree stems wainscoated at first
Came jasper panels—then anon there burst
Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees
And with the larger wove in small intricacies—
And so till she was sated—then came down
Soft lighting on her head a brilliant crown
Wreath’d turban-wise of tender wannish fire
And sprinkled o’er with stars like Ariadne’s tiar,
Approving all—she faded at self will
And shut the Chamber up close hush’d and still;
Complete, and ready, for the revels rude
When dreadful Guests would come to spoil her solitude
The day came soon and all the gossip-rout—
O senseless Lycius[105] ...

········

This is a good sample of the story. Brown is gone to Chichester a-visiting—I shall be alone here for 3 weeks, expecting accounts of your health.





[Pg 290]

CXVI.—TO GEORGE AND GEORGIANA KEATS.
Winchester, September [17, 1819], Friday.

My dear George—I was closely employed in reading and composition in this place, whither I had come from Shanklin for the convenience of a library, when I received your last dated 24th July. You will have seen by the short letter I wrote from Shanklin how matters stand between us and Mr. Jennings. They had not at all moved, and I knew no way of overcoming the inveterate obstinacy of our affairs. On receiving your last, I immediately took a place in the same night’s coach for London. Mr. Abbey behaved extremely well to me, appointed Monday evening at seven to meet me, and observed that he should drink tea at that hour. I gave him the enclosed note and showed him the last leaf of yours to me. He really appeared anxious about it, and promised he would forward your money as quickly as possible. I think I mentioned that Walton was dead.... He will apply to Mr. Gliddon the partner, endeavour to get rid of Mrs. Jennings’ claim, and be expeditious. He has received an answer from my letter to Fry. That is something. We are certainly in a very low estate—I say we, for I am in such a situation, that were it not for the assistance of Brown and Taylor, I must be as badly off as a man can be. I could not raise any sum by the promise of any poem, no, not by the mortgage of my intellect. We must wait a little while. I really have hopes of success. I have finished a tragedy, which if it succeeds will enable me to sell what I may have in manuscript to a good advantage. I have passed my time in reading, writing, and fretting—the last I intend to give up, and stick to the other two. They are the only chances of benefit to us. Your wants will be a fresh spur to me. I assure you you shall more than share what I can get whilst I am still young. The time may come when age will make me more selfish. I have not been well treated by the world, and yet I have,[Pg 291] capitally well. I do not know a person to whom so many purse-strings would fly open as to me, if I could possibly take advantage of them, which I cannot do, for none of the owners of these purses are rich. Your present situation I will not suffer myself to dwell upon. When misfortunes are so real, we are glad enough to escape them and the thought of them. I cannot help thinking Mr. Audubon a dishonest man. Why did he make you believe that he was a man of property? How is it that his circumstances have altered so suddenly? In truth, I do not believe you fit to deal with the world, or at least the American world. But, good God! who can avoid these chances? You have done your best. Take matters as coolly as you can; and confidently expecting help from England, act as if no help were nigh. Mine, I am sure, is a tolerable tragedy; it would have been a bank to me, if just as I had finished it, I had not heard of Kean’s resolution to go to America. That was the worst news I could have had. There is no actor can do the principal character besides Kean. At Covent Garden there is a great chance of its being damm’d. Were it to succeed even there it would lift me out of the mire; I mean the mire of a bad reputation which is continually rising against me. My name with the literary fashionables is vulgar. I am a weaver-boy to them. A tragedy would lift me out of this mess, and mess it is as far as regards our pockets. But be not cast down any more than I am; I feel that I can bear real ills better than imaginary ones. Whenever I find myself growing vapourish, I rouse myself, wash, and put on a clean shirt, brush my hair and clothes, tie my shoestrings neatly, and in fact adonise as I were going out. Then, all clean and comfortable, I sit down to write. This I find the greatest relief. Besides I am becoming accustomed to the privations of the pleasures of sense. In the midst of the world I live like a hermit. I have forgot how to lay plans for the enjoyment of any pleasure. I feel I can bear anything,—any misery, even imprisonment, so long as I have neither wife nor child.[Pg 292] Perhaps you will say yours are your only comfort; they must be. I returned to Winchester the day before yesterday, and am now here alone, for Brown, some days before I left, went to Bedhampton, and there he will be for the next fortnight. The term of his house will be up in the middle of next month when we shall return to Hampstead. On Sunday, I dined with your mother and Hen and Charles in Henrietta Street. Mrs. and Miss Millar were in the country. Charles had been but a few days returned from Paris. I daresay you will have letters expressing the motives of his journey. Mrs. Wylie and Miss Waldegrave seem as quiet as two mice there alone. I did not show your last. I thought it better not, for better times will certainly come, and why should they be unhappy in the meantime? On Monday morning I went to Walthamstow. Fanny looked better than I had seen her for some time. She complains of not hearing from you, appealing to me as if it were half my fault. I had been so long in retirement that London appeared a very odd place. I could not make out I had so many acquaintances, and it was a whole day before I could feel among men. I had another strange sensation. There was not one house I felt any pleasure to call at. Reynolds was in the country, and, saving himself, I am prejudiced against all that family. Dilke and his wife and child were in the country. Taylor was at Nottingham. I was out, and everybody was out. I walked about the streets as in a strange land. Rice was the only one at home. I passed some time with him. I know him better since we have lived a month together in the Isle of Wight. He is the most sensible and even wise man I know. He has a few John Bull prejudices, but they improve him. His illness is at times alarming. We are great friends, and there is no one I like to pass a day with better. Martin called in to bid him good-bye before he set out for Dublin. If you would like to hear one of his jokes, here is one which, at the time, we laughed at a good deal: A Miss ——, with three young ladies, one[Pg 293] of them Martin’s sister, had come a-gadding in the Isle of Wight and took for a few days a cottage opposite ours. We dined with them one day, and as I was saying they had fish. Miss —— said she thought they tasted of the boat. “No” says Martin, very seriously, “they haven’t been kept long enough.” I saw Haslam. He is very much occupied with love and business, being one of Mr. Saunders’ executors and lover to a young woman. He showed me her picture by Severn. I think she is, though not very cunning, too cunning for him. Nothing strikes me so forcibly with a sense of the ridiculous as love. A man in love I do think cuts the sorriest figure in the world; queer, when I know a poor fool to be really in pain about it, I could burst out laughing in his face. His pathetic visage becomes irresistible. Not that I take Haslam as a pattern for lovers; he is a very worthy man and a good friend. His love is very amusing. Somewhere in the Spectator is related an account of a man inviting a party of stutterers and squinters to his table. It would please me more to scrape together a party of lovers—not to dinner, but to tea. There would be no fighting as among knights of old.

Pensive they sit, and roll their languid eyes,
Nibble their toast and cool their tea with sighs;
Or else forget the purpose of the night,
Forget their tea, forget their appetite.
See, with cross’d arms they sit—Ah! hapless crew,
The fire is going out and no one rings
For coals, and therefore no coals Betty brings.
A fly is in the milk-pot. Must he die
Circled by a humane society?
No, no; there, Mr. Werter takes his spoon,
Inserts it, dips the handle, and lo! soon
The little straggler, sav’d from perils dark,
Across the tea-board draws a long wet mark.
Romeo! Arise take snuffers by the handle,
There’s a large cauliflower in each candle.
A winding sheet—ah, me! I must away
To No. 7, just beyond the circus gay.
Alas, my friend, your coat sits very well;
[Pg 294]Where may your Taylor live? I may not tell.
O pardon me. I’m absent now and then.
Where might my Taylor live? I say again
I cannot tell. Let me no more be teased;
He lives in Wapping, might live where he pleased.

You see, I cannot get on without writing, as boys do at school, a few nonsense verses. I begin them, and before I have written six the whim has passed—if there is anything deserving so respectable a name in them. I shall put in a bit of information anywhere, just as it strikes me. Mr. Abbey is to write to me as soon as he can bring matters to bear, and then I am to go to town and tell him the means of forwarding to you through Capper and Hazlewood. I wonder I did not put this before. I shall go on to-morrow; it is so fine now I must take a bit of a walk.


Saturday [September 18].

With my inconstant disposition it is no wonder that this morning, amid all our bad times and misfortunes, I should feel so alert and well-spirited. At this moment you are perhaps in a very different state of mind. It is because my hopes are ever paramount to my despair. I have been reading over a part of a short poem I have composed lately, called Lamia, and I am certain there is that sort of fire in it that must take hold of people some way. Give them either pleasant or unpleasant sensation—what they want is a sensation of some sort. I wish I could pitch the key of your spirits as high as mine is; but your organ-loft is beyond the reach of my voice.

I admire the exact admeasurement of my niece in your mother’s letter—O! the little span-long elf. I am not in the least a judge of the proper weight and size of an infant. Never trouble yourselves about that. She is sure to be a fine woman. Let her have only delicate nails both on hands and feet, and both as small as a May-fly’s, who will live you his life on a 3 square inch of oak-leaf; and nails she must have, quite different from the market-women here, who plough into butter and make a quarter pound taste of it. I intend to write a letter to your wife,[Pg 295] and there I may say more on this little plump subject—I hope she’s plump. Still harping on my daughter. This Winchester is a place tolerably well suited to me. There is a fine cathedral, a college, a Roman Catholic chapel, a Methodist do., and Independent do.; and there is not one loom, or anything like manufacturing beyond bread and butter, in the whole city. There are a number of rich Catholics in the place. It is a respectable, ancient, aristocratic place, and moreover it contains a nunnery. Our set are by no means so hail fellow well met on literary subjects as we were wont to be. Reynolds has turn’d to the law. By the bye, he brought out a little piece at the Lyceum call’d One, Two, Three, Four: by Advertisement. It met with complete success. The meaning of this odd title is explained when I tell you the principal actor is a mimic, who takes off four of our best performers in the course of the farce. Our stage is loaded with mimics. I did not see the piece, being out of town the whole time it was in progress. Dilke is entirely swallowed up in his boy. It is really lamentable to what a pitch he carries a sort of parental mania. I had a letter from him at Shanklin. He went on, a word or two about the Isle of Wight, which is a bit of hobby horse of his, but he soon deviated to his boy. “I am sitting,” says he, “at the window expecting my boy from ——.” I suppose I told you somewhere that he lives in Westminster, and his boy goes to school there, where he gets beaten, and every bruise he has, and I daresay deserves, is very bitter to Dilke. The place I am speaking of puts me in mind of a circumstance which occurred lately at Dilke’s. I think it very rich and dramatic and quite illustrative of the little quiet fun that he will enjoy sometimes. First I must tell you that their house is at the corner of Great Smith Street, so that some of the windows look into one street, and the back windows into another round the corner. Dilke had some old people to dinner—I know not who, but there were two old ladies among them. Brown was there—they had known him from a child.[Pg 296] Brown is very pleasant with old women, and on that day it seems behaved himself so winningly that they became hand and glove together, and a little complimentary. Brown was obliged to depart early. He bid them good-bye and passed into the passage. No sooner was his back turned than the old women began lauding him. When Brown had reached the street door, and was just going, Dilke threw up the window and called: “Brown! Brown! They say you look younger than ever you did!” Brown went on, and had just turned the corner into the other street when Dilke appeared at the back window, crying: “Brown! Brown! By God, they say you’re handsome!” You see what a many words it requires to give any identity to a thing I could have told you in half a minute.

I have been reading lately Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy, and I think you will be very much amused with a page I here copy for you. I call it a Feu de Joie round the batteries of Fort St. Hyphen-de-Phrase on the birthday of the Digamma. The whole alphabet was drawn up in a phalanx on the corner of an old dictionary, band playing, “Amo, amas,” etc.

There’s a dose for you. Fire!! I would give my favourite leg to have written this as a speech in a play. With what effect could Matthews pop-gun it at the pit! This I think will amuse you more than so much poetry. Of that I do not like to copy any, as I am afraid it is too mal à propos for you at present; and yet I will send you some, for by the time you receive it, things in England may have taken a different turn. When I left Mr. Abbey on Monday evening, I walked up Cheapside, but returned to put some letters in the post, and met him again in Bucklesbury. We walked together through the Poultry as far as the baker’s shop he has some concern in—He spoke of it in such a way to me, I thought he wanted me to make an offer to assist him in it. I do believe if I could be a hatter I might be one. He seems anxious about me. He began blowing up Lord Byron while I was sitting with him: “However, may be the fellow says true now and then,” at which he took up a magazine, and read me some extracts from Don Juan (Lord Byron’s last flash poem), and particularly one against literary ambition. I do think I must be well spoken of among sets, for Hodgkinson is more than polite, and the coffee German endeavoured to be very close to me the other night at Covent Garden, where I went at half price before I tumbled into bed. Every one, however distant an acquaintance, behaves in the most conciliating manner to me. You will see I speak of this as a matter of interest. On the next sheet I will give you a little politics.

[Pg 298]In every age there has been in England, for two or three centuries, subjects of great popular interest on the carpet, so that however great the uproar, one can scarcely prophecy any material change in the Government, for as loud disturbances have agitated the country many times. All civilised countries become gradually more enlightened, and there should be a continual change for the better. Look at this country at present, and remember it when it was even thought impious to doubt the justice of a trial by combat. From that time there has been a gradual change. Three great changes have been in progress: first for the better, next for the worse, and a third for the better once more. The first was the gradual annihilation of the tyranny of the nobles, when kings found it their interest to conciliate the common people, elevate them, and be just to them. Just when baronial power ceased, and before standing armies were so dangerous, taxes were few, kings were lifted by the people over the heads of their nobles, and those people held a rod over kings. The change for the worse in Europe was again this: the obligation of kings to the multitude began to be forgotten. Custom had made noblemen the humble servants of kings. Then kings turned to the nobles as the adorners of their power, the slaves of it, and from the people as creatures continually endeavouring to check them. Then in every kingdom there was a long struggle of kings to destroy all popular privileges. The English were the only people in Europe who made a grand kick at this. They were slaves to Henry VIII, but were freemen under William III at the time the French were abject slaves under Louis XIV. The example of England, and the liberal writers of France and England, sowed the seed of opposition to this tyranny, and it was swelling in the ground till it burst out in the French Revolution. That has had an unlucky termination. It put a stop to the rapid progress of free sentiments in England, and gave our Court hopes of turning back to the despotism of the eighteenth century. They have made a handle of[Pg 299] this event in every way to undermine our freedom. They spread a horrid superstition against all innovation and improvement. The present struggle in England of the people is to destroy this superstition. What has roused them to do it is their distresses. Perhaps, on this account, the present distresses of this nation are a fortunate thing though so horrid in their experience. You will see I mean that the French Revolution put a temporary stop to this third change—the change for the better—Now it is in progress again, and I think it is an effectual one. This is no contest between Whig and Tory, but between right and wrong. There is scarcely a grain of party spirit now in England. Right and wrong considered by each man abstractedly, is the fashion. I know very little of these things. I am convinced, however, that apparently small causes make great alterations. There are little signs whereby we may know how matters are going on. This makes the business of Carlisle the bookseller of great amount in my mind. He has been selling deistical pamphlets, republished Tom Paine, and many other works held in superstitious horror. He even has been selling, for some time, immense numbers of a work called The Deist, which comes out in weekly numbers. For this conduct he, I think, has had about a dozen indictments issued against him, for which he has found bail to the amount of many thousand pounds. After all, they are afraid to prosecute. They are afraid of his defence; it would be published in all the papers all over the empire. They shudder at this. The trials would light a flame they could not extinguish. Do you not think this of great import? You will hear by the papers of the proceedings at Manchester, and Hunt’s triumphal entry into London. It would take me a whole day and a quire of paper to give you anything like detail. I will merely mention that it is calculated that 30,000 people were in the streets waiting for him. The whole distance from the Angel at Islington to the Crown and Anchor was lined with multitudes.

[Pg 300]As I passed Colnaghi’s window I saw a profile portrait of Sandt, the destroyer of Kotzebue. His very look must interest every one in his favour. I suppose they have represented him in his college dress. He seems to me like a young Abelard—a fine mouth, cheek bones (and this is no joke) full of sentiment, a fine, unvulgar nose, and plump temples.

On looking over some letters I found the one I wrote, intended for you, from the foot of Helvellyn to Liverpool; but you had sailed, and therefore it was returned to me. It contained, among other nonsense, an acrostic of my sister’s name—and a pretty long name it is. I wrote it in a great hurry which you will see. Indeed I would not copy it if I thought it would ever be seen by any but yourselves.

Give me your patience, sister, while I frame
Exact in capitals your golden name,
Or sue the fair Apollo, and he will
Rouse from his heavy slumber and instil
Great love in me for thee and Poesy.
Imagine not that greatest mastery
And kingdom over all the realms of verse
Nears more to Heaven in aught than when we nurse
And surety give to love and brotherhood.

Anthropopagi in Othello’s mood;
Ulysses storm’d, and his enchanted belt
Glowed with the Muse: but they are never felt
Unbosom’d so, and so eternal made,
Such tender incense in their laurel shade
To all the recent sisters of the Nine,
As this poor offering to you, sister mine.

Kind sister! aye, this third name says you are;
Enchanted has it been the Lord knows where;
And may its taste to you, like good old wine,
Take you to real happiness, and give
Sons, daughters, and a home like honied hive.

Foot of Helvellyn, June 27.

I sent you in my first packet some of my Scotch letters. I find I have one kept back, which was written in the most interesting part of our tour, and will copy[Pg 301] part of it in the hope you will not find it unamusing. I would give now anything for Richardson’s power of making mountains of molehills.

Incipit epistola caledoniensa—


“Dunancullen.”

(I did not know the day of the month, for I find I have not added it. Brown must have been asleep). “Just after my last had gone to the post” (before I go any further, I must premise that I would send the identical letter, instead of taking the trouble to copy it; I do not do so, for it would spoil my notion of the neat manner in which I intend to fold these three genteel sheets. The original is written on coarse paper, and the soft one would ride in the post bag very uneasy. Perhaps there might be a quarrel)[106]

········

I ought to make a large “?” here, but I had better take the opportunity of telling you I have got rid of my haunting sore throat, and conduct myself in a manner not to catch another.

You speak of Lord Byron and me. There is this great difference between us: he describes what he sees—I describe what I imagine. Mine is the hardest task; now see the immense difference. The Edinburgh Reviewers are afraid to touch upon my poem. They do not know what to make of it; they do not like to condemn it, and they will not praise it for fear. They are as shy of it as I should be of wearing a Quaker’s hat. The fact is, they have no real taste. They dare not compromise their judgments on so puzzling a question. If on my[Pg 302] next publication they should praise me, and so lug in Endymion, I will address them in a manner they will not at all relish. The cowardliness of the Edinburgh is more than the abuse of the Quarterly.


Monday [September 20].

This day is a grand day for Winchester. They elect the mayor. It was indeed high time the place should have some sort of excitement. There was nothing going on—all asleep. Not an old maid’s sedan returning from a card party; and if any old women have got tipsy at christenings, they have not exposed themselves in the street. The first night, though, of our arrival here there was a slight uproar took place at about ten of the clock. We heard distinctly a noise patting down the street, as of a walking-cane of the good old dowager breed; and a little minute after we heard a less voice observe, “What a noise the ferril made—it must be loose.” Brown wanted to call the constables, but I observed it was only a little breeze, and would soon pass over. The side streets here are excessively maiden-lady-like; the door-steps always fresh from the flannel. The knockers have a very staid, serious, nay almost awful quietness about them. I never saw so quiet a collection of lions’ and rams’ heads. The doors most part black, with a little brass handle just above the keyhole, so that you may easily shut yourself out of your own house. He! He! There is none of your Lady Bellaston ringing and rapping here; no thundering Jupiter-footmen, no opera-treble tattoos, but a modest lifting up of the knocker by a set of little wee old fingers that peep through the gray mittens, and a dying fall thereof. The great beauty of poetry is that it makes everything in every place interesting. The palatine Venice and the abbotine Winchester are equally interesting. Some time since I began a poem called “The Eve of St. Mark,” quite in the spirit of town quietude. I think I will give you the sensation of walking about an old country[Pg 303] town in a coolish evening. I know not whether I shall ever finish it; I will give it as far as I have gone. Ut tibi placeat—

THE EVE OF ST. MARK.

Upon a Sabbath-day it fell;
Twice holy was the Sabbath-bell,
That call’d the folk to evening prayer;
The city streets were clean and fair
From wholesome drench of April rains;
And, when on western window panes,
The chilly sunset faintly told
Of unmatured green vallies cold,
Of the green thorny bloomless hedge,
Of rivers new with spring-tide sedge,
Of primroses by shelter’d rills,
And daisies on the aguish hills.
Twice holy was the Sabbath-bell:
The silent streets were crowded well
With staid and pious companies,
Warm from their fireside orat’ries;
And moving, with demurest air,
To even-song, and vesper prayer.
Each arched porch, and entry low,
Was fill’d with patient folk and slow,
With whispers hush, and shuffling feet,
While play’d the organ loud and sweet.

The bells had ceas’d, the prayers begun,
And Bertha had not yet half done
A curious volume, patch’d and torn,
That all day long, from earliest morn,
Had taken captive her two eyes,
Among its golden broideries;
Perplex’d her with a thousand things,—
The stars of Heaven, and angels’ wings,
Martyrs in a fiery blaze,
Azure saints and silver rays,
Moses’ breastplate, and the seven
Candlesticks John saw in Heaven,
The winged Lion of St. Mark,
And the Covenantal Ark,
With its many mysteries,
Cherubim and golden mice.
Bertha was a maiden fair,
[Pg 304]Dwelling in the old Minster-square;
From her fireside she could see,
Sidelong, its rich antiquity,
Far as the Bishop’s garden-wall,
Where sycamores and elm-trees tall,
Full-leav’d the forest had outstript,
By no sharp north-wind ever nipt,
So shelter’d by the mighty pile.
Bertha arose, and read awhile,
With forehead ’gainst the window-pane.
Again she try’d, and then again,
Until the dusk eve left her dark
Upon the legend of St. Mark.
From plaited lawn-frill, fine and thin,
She lifted up her soft warm chin,
With aching neck and swimming eyes,
And dazed with saintly imageries.

All was gloom, and silent all,
Save now and then the still footfall
Of one returning homewards late,
Past the echoing minster-gate.
The clamorous daws, that all the day
Above tree-tops and towers play,
Pair by pair had gone to rest,
Each in ancient belfry-nest,
Where asleep they fall betimes,
To music and the drowsy chimes.

All was silent, all was gloom,
Abroad and in the homely room:
Down she sat, poor cheated soul!
And struck a lamp from the dismal coal;
Lean’d forward, with bright drooping hair
And slant book, full against the glare.
Her shadow, in uneasy guise,
Hover’d about, a giant size,
On ceiling-beam and old oak chair,
The parrot’s cage, and panel square;
And the warm angled winter-screen,
On which were many monsters seen,
Call’d doves of Siam, Lima mice,
And legless birds of Paradise,
Macaw and tender Avadavat,
And silken-furr’d Angora cat.
Untir’d she read, her shadow still
Glower’d about, as it would fill
The room with wildest forms and shades,
[Pg 305]As though some ghostly queen of spades
Had come to mock behind her back,
And dance, and ruffle her garments black,
Untir’d she read the legend page,
Of holy Mark, from youth to age,
On land, on sea, in pagan chains,
Rejoicing for his many pains.
Sometimes the learned eremite,
With golden star, or dagger bright,
Referr’d to pious poesies
Written in smallest crow-quill size
Beneath the text; and thus the rhyme
Was parcelled out from time to time:
“... Als writith he of swevenis,
Man han beforne they wake in bliss,
Whanne that hir friendes thinke him bound
In crimped shroude farre under grounde;
And how a litling child mote be
A saint er its nativitie,
Gif that the modre (God her blesse!)
Kepen in solitarinesse,
And kissen devoute the holy croce.
Of Goddes love, and Sathan’s force,—
He writith; and thinges many mo
Of swiche thinges I may not show
Bot I must tellen verilie
Somdel of Saintè Cicilie,
And chieflie what he auctorethe
Of Saintè Markis life and dethe;”

At length her constant eyelids come
Upon the fervent martyrdom;
Then lastly to his holy shrine,
Exalt amid the tapers’ shine
At Venice,—

I hope you will like this for all its carelessness. I must take an opportunity here to observe that though I am writing to you, I am all the while writing at your wife. This explanation will account for my speaking sometimes hoity-toity-ishly, whereas if you were alone, I should sport a little more sober sadness. I am like a squinty gentleman, who, saying soft things to one lady ogles another, or what is as bad, in arguing with a person on his left hand, appeals with his eyes to one on the right. His vision is elastic; he bends it to a certain[Pg 306] object, but having a patent spring it flies off. Writing has this disadvantage of speaking—one cannot write a wink, or a nod, or a grin, or a purse of the lips, or a smile—O law! One cannot put one’s finger to one’s nose, or yerk ye in the ribs, or lay hold of your button in writing; but in all the most lively and titterly parts of my letter you must not fail to imagine me, as the epic poets say, now here, now there; now with one foot pointed at the ceiling, now with another; now with my pen on my ear, now with my elbow in my mouth. O, my friends, you lose the action, and attitude is everything, as Fuseli said when he took up his leg like a musket to shoot a swallow just darting behind his shoulder. And yet does not the word “mum” go for one’s finger beside the nose? I hope it does. I have to make use of the word “mum” before I tell you that Severn has got a little baby—all his own, let us hope. He told Brown he had given up painting, and had turned modeller. I hope sincerely ’tis not a party concern—that no Mr. —— or —— is the real Pinxit and Severn the poor Sculpsit to this work of art. You know he has long studied in the life Academy. “Haydon—yes,” your wife will say, “Here is a sum total account of Haydon again. I wonder your brother don’t put a monthly bulletin in the Philadelphia papers about him. I won’t hear—no. Skip down to the bottom, and there are some more of his verses—skip (lullaby-by) them too.”—“No, let’s go regularly through.”—“I won’t hear a word about Haydon—bless the child, how rioty she is—there, go on there.”

Now, pray go on here, for I have a few words to say about Haydon. Before this chancery threat had cut off every legitimate supply of cash from me, I had a little at my disposal. Haydon being very much in want, I lent him £30 of it. Now in this see-saw game of life, I got nearest to the ground, and this chancery business rivetted me there, so that I was sitting in that uneasy position where the seat slants so abominably. I applied to him for payment. He could not. That was no wonder;[Pg 307] but Goodman Delver, where was the wonder then? Why marry in this: he did not seem to care much about it, and let me go without my money with almost nonchalance, when he ought to have sold his drawings to supply me. I shall perhaps still be acquainted with him, but for friendship, that is at an end. Brown has been my friend in this. He got him to sign a bond, payable at three months. Haslam has assisted me with the return of part of the money you lent him.

Hunt—“there,” says your wife, “there’s another of those dull folk! Not a syllable about my friends? Well, Hunt—What about Hunt? You little thing, see how she bites my finger! My! is not this a tooth?” Well when you have done with the tooth, read on. Not a syllable about your friends! Here are some syllables. As far as I could smoke things on the Sunday before last, thus matters stood in Henrietta Street. Henry was a greater blade then ever I remember to have seen him. He had on a very nice coat, a becoming waistcoat, and buff trousers. I think his face has lost a little of the Spanish-brown, but no flesh. He carved some beef exactly to suit my appetite, as if I had been measured for it. As I stood looking out of the window with Charles, after dinner, quizzing the passengers,—at which I am sorry to say he is too apt,—I observed that this young son of a gun’s whiskers had begun to curl and curl, little twists and twists, all down the sides of his face, getting properly thickest on the angles of the visage. He certainly will have a notable pair of whiskers. “How shiny your gown is in front,” says Charles. “Why don’t you see? ’tis an apron,” says Henry; whereat I scrutinised, and behold your mother had a purple stuff gown on, and over it an apron of the same colour, being the same cloth that was used for the lining. And furthermore to account for the shining, it was the first day of wearing. I guessed as much of the gown—but that is entre nous. Charles likes England better than France. They’ve got a fat, smiling, fair cook as ever[Pg 308] you saw; she is a little lame, but that improves her; it makes her go more swimmingly. When I asked “Is Mrs. Wylie within?” she gave me such a large five-and-thirty-year-old smile, it made me look round upon the fourth stair—it might have been the fifth; but that’s a puzzle. I shall never be able, if I were to set myself a recollecting for a year, to recollect. I think I remember two or three specks in her teeth, but I really can’t say exactly. Your mother said something about Miss Keasle—what that was is quite a riddle to me now, whether she had got fatter or thinner, or broader or longer, straiter, or had taken to the zigzags—whether she had taken to or had left off asses’ milk. That, by the bye, she ought never to touch. How much better it would be to put her out to nurse with the wise woman of Brentford. I can say no more on so spare a subject. Miss Millar now is a different morsel, if one knew how to divide and subdivide, theme her out into sections and subsections, lay a little on every part of her body as it is divided, in common with all her fellow-creatures, in Moor’s Almanack. But, alas, I have not heard a word about her, no cue to begin upon: there was indeed a buzz about her and her mother’s being at old Mrs. So and So’s, who was like to die, as the Jews say. But I dare say, keeping up their dialect, she was not like to die. I must tell you a good thing Reynolds did. ’Twas the best thing he ever said. You know at taking leave of a party at a doorway, sometimes a man dallies and foolishes and gets awkward, and does not know how to make off to advantage. Good-bye—well, good-bye—and yet he does not go; good-bye, and so on,—well, good bless you—you know what I mean. Now Reynolds was in this predicament, and got out of it in a very witty way. He was leaving us at Hampstead. He delayed, and we were pressing at him, and even said “be off,” at which he put the tails of his coat between his legs and sneak’d off as nigh like a spaniel as could be. He went with flying colours. This is very clever. I must, being upon the subject, tell you[Pg 309] another good thing of him. He began, for the service it might be of to him in the law, to learn French; he had lessons at the cheap rate of 2s. 6d. per fag, and observed to Brown, “Gad,” says he, “the man sells his lessons so cheap he must have stolen ’em.” You have heard of Hook, the farce writer. Horace Smith said to one who asked him if he knew Hook, “Oh yes, Hook and I are very intimate.” There’s a page of wit for you, to put John Bunyan’s emblems out of countenance.


Tuesday [September 21].

You see I keep adding a sheet daily till I send the packet off, which I shall not do for a few days, as I am inclined to write a good deal; for there can be nothing so remembrancing and enchaining as a good long letter, be it composed of what it may. From the time you left me our friends say I have altered completely—am not the same person. Perhaps in this letter I am, for in a letter one takes up one’s existence from the time we last met. I daresay you have altered also—every man does—our bodies every seven years are completely material’d. Seven years ago it was not this hand that clinched itself against Hammond. We are like the relict garments of a saint—the same and not the same, for the careful monks patch it and patch it till there’s not a thread of the original garment left, and still they show it for St. Anthony’s shirt. This is the reason why men who have been bosom friends, on being separated for any number of years meet coldly, neither of them knowing why. The fact is they are both altered.

Men who live together have a silent moulding and influencing power over each other. They interassimilate. ’Tis an uneasy thought, that in seven years the same hands cannot greet each other again. All this may be obviated by a wilful and dramatic exercise of our minds towards each other. Some think I have lost that poetic ardour and fire ’tis said I once had—the fact is, perhaps I have; but, instead of that, I hope I shall substitute a more thoughtful[Pg 310] and quiet power. I am more frequently now contented to read and think, but now and then haunted with ambitious thoughts. Quieter in my pulse, improved in my digestion, exerting myself against vexing speculations, scarcely content to write the best verses for the fever they leave behind. I want to compose without this fever. I hope I one day shall. You would scarcely imagine I could live alone so comfortably. “Kepen in solitarinesse.” I told Anne, the servant here, the other day, to say I was not at home if any one should call. I am not certain how I should endure loneliness and bad weather together. Now the time is beautiful. I take a walk every day for an hour before dinner, and this is generally my walk: I go out the back gate, across one street into the cathedral yard, which is always interesting; there I pass under the trees along a paved path, pass the beautiful front of the cathedral, turn to the left under a stone doorway,—then I am on the other side of the building,—which leaving behind me, I pass on through two college-like squares, seemingly built for the dwelling-place of deans and prebendaries, garnished with grass and shaded with trees; then I pass through one of the old city gates, and then you are in one college street, through which I pass, and at the end thereof crossing some meadows, and at last a country alley of gardens, I arrive, that is my worship arrives, at the foundation of St. Cross, which is a very interesting old place, both for its gothic tower and alms square and for the appropriation of its rich rents to a relation of the Bishop of Winchester. Then I pass across St. Cross meadows till you come to the most beautifully clear river—now this is only one mile of my walk. I will spare you the other two till after supper, when they would do you more good. You must avoid going the first mile best after dinner—


[Wednesday, September 22.]

I could almost advise you to put by this nonsense until you are lifted out of your difficulties; but when[Pg 311] you come to this part, feel with confidence what I now feel, that though there can be no stop put to troubles we are inheritors of, there can be, and must be, an end to immediate difficulties. Rest in the confidence that I will not omit any exertion to benefit you by some means or other—If I cannot remit you hundreds, I will tens, and if not that, ones. Let the next year be managed by you as well as possible—the next month, I mean, for I trust you will soon receive Abbey’s remittance. What he can send you will not be a sufficient capital to ensure you any command in America. What he has of mine I have nearly anticipated by debts, so I would advise you not to sink it, but to live upon it, in hopes of my being able to increase it. To this end I will devote whatever I may gain for a few years to come, at which period I must begin to think of a security of my own comforts, when quiet will become more pleasant to me than the world. Still, I would have you doubt my success. ’Tis at present the cast of a die with me. You say, “These things will be a great torment to me.” I shall not suffer them to be so. I shall only exert myself the more, while the seriousness of their nature will prevent me from nursing up imaginary griefs. I have not had the blue devils once since I received your last. I am advised not to publish till it is seen whether the tragedy will or not succeed. Should it, a few months may see me in the way of acquiring property. Should it not, it will be a drawback, and I shall have to perform a longer literary pilgrimage. You will perceive that it is quite out of my interest to come to America. What could I do there? How could I employ myself out of reach of libraries? You do not mention the name of the gentleman who assists you. ’Tis an extraordinary thing. How could you do without that assistance? I will not trust myself with brooding over this. The following is an extract from a letter of Reynolds to me:—

“I am glad to hear you are getting on so well with your writings. I hope you are not neglecting the revision[Pg 312] of your poems for the press, from which I expect more than you do.”

The first thought that struck me on reading your last was to mortgage a poem to Murray, but on more consideration, I made up my mind not to do so; my reputation is very low; he would not have negotiated my bill of intellect, or given me a very small sum. I should have bound myself down for some time. ’Tis best to meet present misfortunes; not for a momentary good to sacrifice great benefits which one’s own untrammell’d and free industry may bring one in the end. In all this do never think of me as in any way unhappy: I shall not be so. I have a great pleasure in thinking of my responsibility to you, and shall do myself the greatest luxury if I can succeed in any way so as to be of assistance to you. We shall look back upon these times, even before our eyes are at all dim—I am convinced of it. But be careful of those Americans. I could almost advise you to come, whenever you have the sum of £500, to England. Those Americans will, I am afraid, still fleece you. If ever you think of such a thing, you must bear in mind the very different state of society here,—the immense difficulties of the times, the great sum required per annum to maintain yourself in any decency. In fact the whole is with Providence. I know not how to advise you but by advising you to advise with yourself. In your next tell me at large your thoughts about America—what chance there is of succeeding there, for it appears to me you have as yet been somehow deceived. I cannot help thinking Mr. Audubon has deceived you. I shall not like the sight of him. I shall endeavour to avoid seeing him. You see how puzzled I am. I have no meridian to fix you to, being the slave of what is to happen. I think I may bid you finally remain in good hopes, and not tease yourself with my changes and variations of mind. If I say nothing decisive in any one particular part of my letter, you may glean the truth from the whole pretty correctly. You may wonder why I had[Pg 313] not put your affairs with Abbey in train on receiving your letter before last, to which there will reach you a short answer dated from Shanklin. I did write and speak to Abbey, but to no purpose. Your last, with the enclosed note, has appealed home to him. He will not see the necessity of a thing till he is hit in the mouth. ’Twill be effectual.

I am sorry to mix up foolish and serious things together, but in writing so much I am obliged to do so, and I hope sincerely the tenor of your mind will maintain itself better. In the course of a few months I shall be as good an Italian scholar as I am a French one. I am reading Ariosto at present, not managing more than six or eight stanzas at a time. When I have done this language, so as to be able to read it tolerably well, I shall set myself to get complete in Latin, and there my learning must stop. I do not think of returning upon Greek. I would not go even so far if I were not persuaded of the power the knowledge of any language gives one. The fact is I like to be acquainted with foreign languages. It is, besides, a nice way of filling up intervals, etc. Also the reading of Dante is well worth the while; and in Latin there is a fund of curious literature of the Middle Ages, the works of many great men—Aretino and Sannazaro and Machiavelli. I shall never become attached to a foreign idiom, so as to put it into my writings. The Paradise Lost, though so fine in itself, is a corruption of our language. It should be kept as it is—unique, a curiosity, a beautiful and grand curiosity, the most remarkable production of the world; a northern dialect accommodating itself to Greek and Latin inversions and intonations. The purest English, I think—or what ought to be purest—is Chatterton’s. The language had existed long enough to be entirely uncorrupted of Chaucer’s Gallicisms, and still the old words are used. Chatterton’s language is entirely northern. I prefer the native music of it to Milton’s, cut by feet. I have but lately stood on my[Pg 314] guard against Milton. Life to him would be death to me. Miltonic verse cannot be written, but is the verse of art. I wish to devote myself to another verse alone.


Friday [September 24].

I have been obliged to intermit your letter for two days (this being Friday morning), from having had to attend to other correspondence. Brown, who was at Bedhampton, went thence to Chichester, and I am still directing my letters Bedhampton. There arose a misunderstanding about them. I began to suspect my letters had been stopped from curiosity. However, yesterday Brown had four letters from me all in a lump, and the matter is cleared up. Brown complained very much in his letter to me of yesterday of the great alteration the disposition of Dilke has undergone. He thinks of nothing but political justice and his boy. Now, the first political duty a man ought to have a mind to is the happiness of his friends. I wrote Brown a comment on the subject, wherein I explained what I thought of Dilke’s character, which resolved itself into this conclusion, that Dilke was a man who cannot feel he has a personal identity unless he has made up his mind about everything. The only means of strengthening one’s intellect is to make up one’s mind about nothing—to let the mind be a thoroughfare for all thoughts, not a select party. The genus is not scarce in population; all the stubborn arguers you meet with are of the same brood. They never begin upon a subject they have not pre-resolved on. They want to hammer their nail into you, and if you have the point, still they think you wrong. Dilke will never come at a truth as long as he lives, because he is always trying at it. He is a Godwin Methodist.

I must not forget to mention that your mother show’d me the lock of hair—’tis of a very dark colour for so young a creature. Then it is two feet in length. I shall not stand a barley corn higher. That’s not fair;[Pg 315] one ought to go on growing as well as others. At the end of this sheet I shall stop for the present and send it off. You may expect another letter immediately after it. As I never know the day of the month but by chance, I put here that this is the 24th September.

I would wish you here to stop your ears, for I have a word or two to say to your wife.



My dear Sister—In the first place I must quarrel with you for sending me such a shabby piece of paper, though that is in some degree made up for by the beautiful impression of the seal. You should like to know what I was doing the first of May. Let me see—I cannot recollect. I have all the Examiners ready to send—they will be a great treat to you when they reach you. I shall pack them up when my business with Abbey has come to a good conclusion, and the remittance is on the road to you. I have dealt round your best wishes like a pack of cards, but being always given to cheat myself, I have turned up ace. You see I am making game of you. I see you are not all happy in that America. England, however, would not be over happy for you if you were here. Perhaps ’twould be better to be teased here than there. I must preach patience to you both. No step hasty or injurious to you must be taken. You say let one large sheet be all to me. You will find more than that in different parts of this packet for you. Certainly, I have been caught in rains. A catch in the rain occasioned my last sore throat; but as for red-haired girls, upon my word, I do not recollect ever having seen one. Are you quizzing me or Miss Waldegrave when you talk of promenading? As for pun-making, I wish it was as good a trade as pin-making. There is very little business of that sort going on now. We struck for wages, like the Manchester weavers, but to no purpose. So we are all out of employ. I am more lucky than some, you see, by having an opportunity of exporting a few—getting into a little[Pg 316] foreign trade, which is a comfortable thing. I wish one could get change for a pun in silver currency. I would give three and a half any night to get into Drury pit, but they won’t ring at all. No more will notes you will say; but notes are different things, though they make together a pun-note as the term goes. If I were your son, I shouldn’t mind you, though you rapt me with the scissors. But, Lord! I should be out of favour when the little un be comm’d. You have made an uncle of me, you have, and I don’t know what to make of myself. I suppose next there will be a nevey. You say in my last, write directly. I have not received your letter above ten days. The thought of your little girl puts me in mind of a thing I heard a Mr. Lamb say. A child in arms was passing by towards its mother, in the nurse’s arms. Lamb took hold of the long clothes, saying: “Where, God bless me, where does it leave off?”


Saturday [September 25].

If you would prefer a joke or two to anything else, I have two for you, fresh hatched, just ris, as the bakers’ wives say by the rolls. The first I played off on Brown; the second I played on myself. Brown, when he left me, “Keats,” says he, “my good fellow” (staggering upon his left heel and fetching an irregular pirouette with his right); “Keats,” says he (depressing his left eyebrow and elevating his right one), though by the way at the moment I did not know which was the right one; “Keats,” says he (still in the same posture, but furthermore both his hands in his waistcoat pockets and putting out his stomach), “Keats—my—go-o-ood fell-o-o-ooh,” says he (interlarding his exclamation with certain ventriloquial parentheses),—no, this is all a lie—He was as sober as a judge, when a judge happens to be sober, and said: “Keats, if any letters come for me, do not forward them, but open them and give me the marrow of them in a few words.” At the time I wrote my first to him no letter had arrived. I thought I would invent[Pg 317] one, and as I had not time to manufacture a long one, I dabbed off a short one, and that was the reason of the joke succeeding beyond my expectations. Brown let his house to a Mr. Benjamin—a Jew. Now, the water which furnishes the house is in a tank, sided with a composition of lime, and the lime impregnates the water unpleasantly. Taking advantage of this circumstance, I pretended that Mr. Benjamin had written the following short note—

Sir—By drinking your damn’d tank water I have got the gravel. What reparation can you make to me and my family?

Nathan Benjamin.

By a fortunate hit, I hit upon his right—heathen name—his right pronomen. Brown in consequence, it appears, wrote to the surprised Mr. Benjamin the following—

Sir—I cannot offer you any remuneration until your gravel shall have formed itself into a stone—when I will cut you with pleasure.

C. Brown.

This of Brown’s Mr. Benjamin has answered, insisting on an explanation of this singular circumstance. B. says: “When I read your letter and his following, I roared; and in came Mr. Snook, who on reading them seem’d likely to burst the hoops of his fat sides.” So the joke has told well.

Now for the one I played on myself. I must first give you the scene and the dramatis personæ. There are an old major and his youngish wife here in the next apartments to me. His bedroom door opens at an angle with my sitting-room door. Yesterday I was reading as demurely as a parish clerk, when I heard a rap at the door. I got up and opened it; no one was to be seen. I listened, and heard some one in the major’s room. Not content with this, I went upstairs and down, looked in the cupboards and watch’d. At last I set myself to[Pg 318] read again, not quite so demurely, when there came a louder rap. I was determined to find out who it was. I looked out; the staircases were all silent. “This must be the major’s wife,” said I. “At all events I will see the truth.” So I rapt me at the major’s door and went in, to the utter surprise and confusion of the lady, who was in reality there. After a little explanation, which I can no more describe than fly, I made my retreat from her, convinced of my mistake. She is to all appearance a silly body, and is really surprised about it. She must have been, for I have discovered that a little girl in the house was the rapper. I assure you she has nearly made me sneeze. If the lady tells tits, I shall put a very grave and moral face on the matter with the old gentleman, and make his little boy a present of a humming top.


[Monday, September 27.]

My dear George—This Monday morning, the 27th, I have received your last, dated 12th July. You say you have not heard from England for three months. Then my letter from Shanklin, written, I think, at the end of June, has not reach’d you. You shall not have cause to think I neglect you. I have kept this back a little time in expectation of hearing from Mr. Abbey. You will say I might have remained in town to be Abbey’s messenger in these affairs. That I offered him, but he in his answer convinced me that he was anxious to bring the business to an issue. He observed, that by being himself the agent in the whole, people might be more expeditious. You say you have not heard for three months, and yet your letters have the tone of knowing how our affairs are situated, by which I conjecture I acquainted you with them in a letter previous to the Shanklin one. That I may not have done. To be certain, I will here state that it is in consequence of Mrs. Jennings threatening a chancery suit that you have been kept from the receipt of monies, and myself deprived of any help from Abbey. I am glad you say you keep up[Pg 319] your spirits. I hope you make a true statement on that score. Still keep them up, for we are all young. I can only repeat here that you shall hear from me again immediately. Notwithstanding this bad intelligence, I have experienced some pleasure in receiving so correctly two letters from you, as it gives me, if I may so say, a distant idea of proximity. This last improves upon my little niece—kiss her for me. Do not fret yourself about the delay of money on account of my immediate opportunity being lost, for in a new country whoever has money must have an opportunity of employing it in many ways. The report runs now more in favour of Kean stopping in England. If he should, I have confident hopes of our tragedy. If he invokes the hot-blooded character of Ludolph,—and he is the only actor that can do it,—he will add to his own fame and improve my fortune. I will give you a half-dozen lines of it before I part as a specimen—

Not as a swordsman would I pardon crave,
But as a son: the bronz’d Centurion,
Long-toil’d in foreign wars, and whose high deeds
Are shaded in a forest of tall spears,
Known only to his troop, hath greater plea
Of favour with my sire than I can have.

Believe me, my dear brother and sister, your affectionate and anxious Brother
John Keats.





CXVII.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
Winchester, September 22, 1819.

My dear Reynolds—I was very glad to hear from Woodhouse that you would meet in the country. I hope you will pass some pleasant time together. Which I wish to make pleasanter by a brace of letters, very highly to be estimated, as really I have had very bad luck with this sort of game this season. I “kepen in solitarinesse,” for Brown has gone a-visiting. I am surprised myself at[Pg 320] the pleasure I live alone in. I can give you no news of the place here, or any other idea of it but what I have to this effect written to George. Yesterday I say to him was a grand day for Winchester. They elected a Mayor. It was indeed high time the place should receive some sort of excitement. There was nothing going on: all asleep: not an old maid’s sedan returning from a card party: and if any old woman got tipsy at Christenings they did not expose it in the streets. The first night though of our arrival here, there was a slight uproar took place at about 10 o’ the Clock. We heard distinctly a noise pattering down the High Street as of a walking cane of the good old Dowager breed; and a little minute after we heard a less voice observe “What a noise the ferril made—it must be loose.” Brown wanted to call the constables, but I observed ’twas only a little breeze and would soon pass over.—The side streets here are excessively maiden-lady-like: the door-steps always fresh from the flannel. The knockers have a staid serious, nay almost awful quietness about them. I never saw so quiet a collection of Lions’ and Rams’ heads. The doors are most part black, with a little brass handle just above the keyhole, so that in Winchester a man may very quietly shut himself out of his own house. How beautiful the season is now—How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it. Really, without joking, chaste weather—Dian skies—I never liked stubble-fields so much as now—Aye better than the chilly green of the Spring. Somehow, a stubble-field looks warm—in the same way that some pictures look warm. This struck me so much in my Sunday’s walk that I composed upon it.[107]

I hope you are better employed than in gaping after weather. I have been at different times so happy as not to know what weather it was—No I will not copy a[Pg 321] parcel of verses. I always somehow associate Chatterton with autumn. He is the purest writer in the English Language. He has no French idiom or particles, like Chaucer—’tis genuine English Idiom in English words. I have given up Hyperion—there were too many Miltonic inversions in it—Miltonic verse cannot be written but in an artful, or, rather, artist’s humour. I wish to give myself up to other sensations. English ought to be kept up. It may be interesting to you to pick out some lines from Hyperion, and put a mark × to the false beauty proceeding from art, and one || to the true voice of feeling. Upon my soul ’twas imagination—I cannot make the distinction—Every now and then there is a Miltonic intonation—But I cannot make the division properly. The fact is, I must take a walk: for I am writing a long letter to George: and have been employed at it all the morning. You will ask, have I heard from George. I am sorry to say not the best news—I hope for better. This is the reason, among others, that if I write to you it must be in such a scrap-like way. I have no meridian to date interests from, or measure circumstances—To-night I am all in a mist; I scarcely know what’s what—But you knowing my unsteady and vagarish disposition, will guess that all this turmoil will be settled by to-morrow morning. It strikes me to-night that I have led a very odd sort of life for the two or three last years—Here and there—no anchor—I am glad of it.—If you can get a peep at Babbicombe before you leave the country, do.—I think it the finest place I have seen, or is to be seen, in the South. There is a Cottage there I took warm water at, that made up for the tea. I have lately shirk’d some friends of ours, and I advise you to do the same, I mean the blue-devils—I am never at home to them. You need not fear them while you remain in Devonshire—there will be some of the family waiting for you at the Coach office—but go by another Coach.

I shall beg leave to have a third opinion in the first[Pg 322] discussion you have with Woodhouse—just half-way, between both. You know I will not give up my argument—In my walk to-day I stoop’d under a railing that lay across my path, and asked myself “Why I did not get over.” “Because,” answered I, “no one wanted to force you under.” I would give a guinea to be a reasonable man—good sound sense—a says what he thinks and does what he says man—and did not take snuff. They say men near death, however mad they may have been, come to their senses—I hope I shall here in this letter—there is a decent space to be very sensible in—many a good proverb has been in less—nay, I have heard of the statutes at large being changed into the Statutes at Small and printed for a watch paper.

Your sisters, by this time, must have got the Devonshire “ees”—short ees—you know ’em—they are the prettiest ees in the language. O how I admire the middle-sized delicate Devonshire girls of about fifteen. There was one at an Inn door holding a quartern of brandy—the very thought of her kept me warm a whole stage—and a 16 miler too—“You’ll pardon me for being jocular.”

Ever your affectionate friend
John Keats.





CXVIII.—TO CHARLES WENTWORTH DILKE.
Winchester, Wednesday Eve.
[September 22, 1819.]

My dear Dilke—Whatever I take to for the time I cannot leave off in a hurry; letter writing is the go now; I have consumed a quire at least. You must give me credit, now, for a free Letter when it is in reality an interested one, on two points, the one requestive, the other verging to the pros and cons. As I expect they will lead me to seeing and conferring with you in a short time, I shall not enter at all upon a letter I have lately received from George, of not the most comfortable intelligence: but proceed to these two points, which if you can theme[Pg 323] out into sections and subsections, for my edification, you will oblige me. The first I shall begin upon, the other will follow like a tail to a Comet. I have written to Brown on the subject, and can but go over the same ground with you in a very short time, it not being more in length than the ordinary paces between the Wickets. It concerns a resolution I have taken to endeavour to acquire something by temporary writing in periodical works. You must agree with me how unwise it is to keep feeding upon hopes, which depending so much on the state of temper and imagination, appear gloomy or bright, near or afar off, just as it happens. Now an act has three parts—to act, to do, and to perform—I mean I should do something for my immediate welfare. Even if I am swept away like a spider from a drawing-room, I am determined to spin—homespun anything for sale. Yea, I will traffic. Anything but Mortgage my Brain to Blackwood. I am determined not to lie like a dead lump. If Reynolds had not taken to the law, would he not be earning something? Why cannot I. You may say I want tact—that is easily acquired. You may be up to the slang of a cock pit in three battles. It is fortunate I have not before this been tempted to venture on the common. I should a year or two ago have spoken my mind on every subject with the utmost simplicity. I hope I have learned a little better and am confident I shall be able to cheat as well as any literary Jew of the Market and shine up an article on anything without much knowledge of the subject, aye like an orange. I would willingly have recourse to other means. I cannot; I am fit for nothing but literature. Wait for the issue of this Tragedy? No—there cannot be greater uncertainties east, west, north, and south than concerning dramatic composition. How many months must I wait! Had I not better begin to look about me now? If better events supersede this necessity what harm will be done? I have no trust whatever on Poetry. I don’t wonder at it—the marvel is to me how people read so much of it.[Pg 324] I think you will see the reasonableness of my plan. To forward it I purpose living in cheap Lodging in Town, that I may be in the reach of books and information, of which there is here a plentiful lack. If I can find any place tolerably comfortable I will settle myself and fag till I can afford to buy Pleasure—which if I never can afford I must go without. Talking of Pleasure, this moment I was writing with one hand, and with the other holding to my Mouth a Nectarine—good God how fine. It went down soft, pulpy, slushy, oozy—all its delicious embonpoint melted down my throat like a large beatified Strawberry. I shall certainly breed. Now I come to my request. Should you like me for a neighbour again? Come, plump it out, I won’t blush. I should also be in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Wylie, which I should be glad of, though that of course does not influence me. Therefore will you look about Marsham, or Rodney Street for a couple of rooms for me. Rooms like the gallant’s legs in Massinger’s time, “as good as the times allow, Sir.” I have written to-day to Reynolds, and to Woodhouse. Do you know him? He is a Friend of Taylor’s at whom Brown has taken one of his funny odd dislikes. I’m sure he’s wrong, because Woodhouse likes my Poetry—conclusive. I ask your opinion and yet I must say to you as to him, Brown, that if you have anything to say against it I shall be as obstinate and heady as a Radical. By the Examiner coming in your handwriting you must be in Town. They have put me into spirits. Notwithstanding my aristocratic temper I cannot help being very much pleased with the present public proceedings. I hope sincerely I shall be able to put a Mite of help to the Liberal side of the Question before I die. If you should have left Town again (for your Holidays cannot be up yet) let me know when this is forwarded to you. A most extraordinary mischance has befallen two letters I wrote Brown—one from London whither I was obliged to go on business for George; the other from this place since my return. I can’t make it out. I am excessively[Pg 325] sorry for it. I shall hear from Brown and from you almost together, for I have sent him a Letter to-day: you must positively agree with me or by the delicate toe nails of the virgin I will not open your Letters. If they are as David says “suspicious looking letters” I won’t open them. If St. John had been half as cunning he might have seen the revelations comfortably in his own room, without giving angels the trouble of breaking open seals. Remember me to Mrs. D. and the West-monasteranian and believe me

Ever your sincere friend
John Keats.





CXIX.—TO CHARLES BROWN.
Winchester, September 23, 1819.

········

Now I am going to enter on the subject of self. It is quite time I should set myself doing something, and live no longer upon hopes. I have never yet exerted myself. I am getting into an idle-minded, vicious way of life, almost content to live upon others. In no period of my life have I acted with any self-will but in throwing up the apothecary profession. That I do not repent of. Look at Reynolds, if he was not in the law, he would be acquiring, by his abilities, something towards his support. My occupation is entirely literary: I will do so, too. I will write, on the liberal side of the question, for whoever will pay me. I have not known yet what it is to be diligent. I purpose living in town in a cheap lodging, and endeavouring, for a beginning, to get the theatricals of some paper. When I can afford to compose deliberate poems, I will. I shall be in expectation of an answer to this. Look on my side of the question. I am convinced I am right. Suppose the tragedy should succeed,—there will be no harm done. And here I will take an opportunity of making a remark or two on our friendship, and on all your good offices to me. I have a natural timidity[Pg 326] of mind in these matters; liking better to take the feeling between us for granted, than to speak of it. But, good God! what a short while you have known me! I feel it a sort of duty thus to recapitulate, however unpleasant it may be to you. You have been living for others more than any man I know. This is a vexation to me, because it has been depriving you, in the very prime of your life, of pleasures which it was your duty to procure. As I am speaking in general terms, this may appear nonsense; you perhaps will not understand it; but if you can go over, day by day, any month of the last year, you will know what I mean. On the whole however this is a subject that I cannot express myself upon—I speculate upon it frequently; and believe me the end of my speculations is always an anxiety for your happiness. This anxiety will not be one of the least incitements to the plan I purpose pursuing. I had got into a habit of mind of looking towards you as a help in all difficulties—This very habit would be the parent of idleness and difficulties. You will see it is a duty I owe myself to break the neck of it. I do nothing for my subsistence—make no exertion—At the end of another year you shall applaud me, not for verses, but for conduct. While I have some immediate cash, I had better settle myself quietly, and fag on as others do. I shall apply to Hazlitt, who knows the market as well as any one, for something to bring me in a few pounds as soon as possible. I shall not suffer my pride to hinder me. The whisper may go round; I shall not hear it. If I can get an article in the Edinburgh, I will. One must not be delicate—Nor let this disturb you longer than a moment. I look forward with a good hope that we shall one day be passing free, untrammelled, unanxious time together. That can never be if I continue a dead lump. I shall be expecting anxiously an answer from you. If it does not arrive in a few days this will have miscarried, and I shall come straight to —— before I go to town, which you I am sure will agree had better[Pg 327] be done while I still have some ready cash. By the middle of October I shall expect you in London. We will then set at the theatres. If you have anything to gainsay, I shall be even as the deaf adder which stoppeth her ears.

········





CXX.—TO CHARLES BROWN.
Winchester, September 23, 1819.

········

Do not suffer me to disturb you unpleasantly: I do not mean that you should not suffer me to occupy your thoughts, but to occupy them pleasantly; for I assure you I am as far from being unhappy as possible. Imaginary grievances have always been more my torment than real ones—You know this well—Real ones will never have any other effect upon me than to stimulate me to get out of or avoid them. This is easily accounted for—Our imaginary woes are conjured up by our passions, and are fostered by passionate feeling: our real ones come of themselves, and are opposed by an abstract exertion of mind. Real grievances are displacers of passion. The imaginary nail a man down for a sufferer, as on a cross; the real spur him up into an agent. I wish, at one view, you would see my heart towards you. ’Tis only from a high tone of feeling that I can put that word upon paper—out of poetry. I ought to have waited for your answer to my last before I wrote this. I felt however compelled to make a rejoinder to yours. I had written to Dilke on the subject of my last, I scarcely know whether I shall send my letter now. I think he would approve of my plan; it is so evident. Nay, I am convinced, out and out, that by prosing for a while in periodical works I may maintain myself decently.

········





[Pg 328]

CXXI.—TO CHARLES WENTWORTH DILKE.
Winchester, Friday, October 1 [1819].

My dear Dilke—For sundry reasons, which I will explain to you when I come to Town, I have to request you will do me a great favour as I must call it knowing how great a Bore it is. That your imagination may not have time to take too great an alarm I state immediately that I want you to hire me a couple of rooms (a Sitting Room and bed room for myself alone) in Westminster. Quietness and cheapness are the essentials: but as I shall with Brown be returned by next Friday you cannot in that space have sufficient time to make any choice selection, and need not be very particular as I can when on the spot suit myself at leisure. Brown bids me remind you not to send the Examiners after the third. Tell Mrs. D. I am obliged to her for the late ones which I see are directed in her hand. Excuse this mere business letter for I assure you I have not a syllable at hand on any subject in the world.

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





CXXII.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
Winchester, Sunday Morn [October 3, 1819].

My dear Haydon—Certainly I might: but a few Months pass away before we are aware. I have a great aversion to letter writing, which grows more and more upon me; and a greater to summon up circumstances before me of an unpleasant nature. I was not willing to trouble you with them. Could I have dated from my Palace of Milan you would have heard from me. Not even now will I mention a word of my affairs—only that “I Rab am here” but shall not be here more than a Week more, as I purpose to settle in Town and work my way with the rest. I hope I shall never be so silly as to injure my health and industry for the future by speaking,[Pg 329] writing or fretting about my non-estate. I have no quarrel, I assure you, of so weighty a nature, with the world, on my own account as I have on yours. I have done nothing—except for the amusement of a few people who refine upon their feelings till anything in the un-understandable way will go down with them—people predisposed for sentiment. I have no cause to complain because I am certain anything really fine will in these days be felt. I have no doubt that if I had written Othello I should have been cheered by as good a mob as Hunt. So would you be now if the operation of painting was as universal as that of Writing. It is not: and therefore it did behove men I could mention among whom I must place Sir George Beaumont to have lifted you up above sordid cares. That this has not been done is a disgrace to the country. I know very little of Painting, yet your pictures follow me into the Country. When I am tired of reading I often think them over and as often condemn the spirit of modern Connoisseurs. Upon the whole, indeed, you have no complaint to make, being able to say what so few Men can, “I have succeeded.” On sitting down to write a few lines to you these are the uppermost in my mind, and, however I may be beating about the arctic while your spirit has passed the line, you may lay to a minute and consider I am earnest as far as I can see. Though at this present “I have great dispositions to write” I feel every day more and more content to read. Books are becoming more interesting and valuable to me. I may say I could not live without them. If in the course of a fortnight you can procure me a ticket to the British Museum I will make a better use of it than I did in the first instance. I shall go on with patience in the confidence that if I ever do anything worth remembering the Reviewers will no more be able to stumble-block me than the Royal Academy could you. They have the same quarrel with you that the Scotch nobles had with Wallace. The fame they have lost through you is no joke to them. Had it not been for[Pg 330] you Fuseli would have been not as he is major but maximus domo. What Reviewers can put a hindrance to must be—a nothing—or mediocre which is worse. I am sorry to say that since I saw you I have been guilty of a practical joke upon Brown which has had all the success of an innocent Wildfire among people. Some day in the next week you shall hear it from me by word of Mouth. I have not seen the portentous Book which was skummer’d at you just as I left town. It may be light enough to serve you as a Cork Jacket and save you for a while the trouble of swimming. I heard the Man went raking and rummaging about like any Richardson. That and the Memoirs of Menage are the first I shall be at. From Sr. G. B.’s, Lord Ms[108] and particularly Sr. John Leicesters good lord deliver us. I shall expect to see your Picture plumped out like a ripe Peach—you would not be very willing to give me a slice of it. I came to this place in the hopes of meeting with a Library but was disappointed. The High Street is as quiet as a Lamb. The knockers are dieted to three raps per diem. The walks about are interesting from the many old Buildings and archways. The view of the High Street through the Gate of the City in the beautiful September evening light has amused me frequently. The bad singing of the Cathedral I do not care to smoke—being by myself I am not very coy in my taste. At St. Cross there is an interesting picture of Albert Dürer’s—who living in such war-like times perhaps was forced to paint in his Gauntlets—so we must make all allowances.

I am, my dear Haydon, Yours ever
John Keats.

Brown has a few words to say to you and will cross this.

CXXIII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place[109] [October 16, 1819].

My dear Fanny—My Conscience is always reproaching me for neglecting you for so long a time. I have been returned from Winchester this fortnight, and as yet I have not seen you. I have no excuse to offer—I should have no excuse. I shall expect to see you the next time I call on Mr. A. about George’s affairs which perplex me a great deal—I should have to-day gone to see if you were in town—but as I am in an industrious humour (which is so necessary to my livelihood for the future) I am loath to break through it though it be merely for one day, for when I am inclined I can do a great deal in a day—I am more fond of pleasure than study (many men have prefer’d the latter) but I have become resolved to know something which you will credit when I tell you I have left off animal food that my brains may never henceforth be in a greater mist than is theirs by nature—I took lodgings in Westminster for the purpose of being in the reach of Books, but am now returned to Hampstead being induced to it by the habit I have acquired in this room I am now in and also from the pleasure of being free from paying any petty attentions to a diminutive house-keeping. Mr. Brown has been my great friend for some time—without[Pg 332] him I should have been in, perhaps, personal distress—as I know you love me though I do not deserve it, I am sure you will take pleasure in being a friend to Mr. Brown even before you know him.—My lodgings for two or three days were close in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Dilke who never sees me but she enquires after you—I have had letters from George lately which do not contain, as I think I told you in my last, the best news—I have hopes for the best—I trust in a good termination to his affairs which you please God will soon hear of—It is better you should not be teased with the particulars. The whole amount of the ill news is that his mercantile speculations have not had success in consequence of the general depression of trade in the whole province of Kentucky and indeed all America.—I have a couple of shells for you you will call pretty.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





CXXIV.—TO JOSEPH SEVERN.
Wentworth Place, Wednesday
[October 27? 1819].

Dear Severn—Either your joke about staying at home is a very old one or I really call’d. I don’t remember doing so. I am glad to hear you have finish’d the Picture and am more anxious to see it than I have time to spare: for I have been so very lax, unemployed, unmeridian’d, and objectless these two months that I even grudge indulging (and that is no great indulgence considering the Lecture is not over till 9 and the lecture room seven miles from Wentworth Place) myself by going to Hazlitt’s Lecture. If you have hours to the amount of a brace of dozens to throw away you may sleep nine of them here in your little Crib and chat the rest. When your Picture is up and in a good light I shall make a point of meeting you at the Academy if you will let me know when. If you should be at the Lecture to-morrow evening I shall[Pg 333] see you—and congratulate you heartily—Haslam I know “is very Beadle to an amorous sigh.”

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





CXXV.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
Wentworth Place, Hampstead,
November 17 [1819].

My dear Taylor—I have come to a determination not to publish anything I have now ready written: but, for all that, to publish a poem before long, and that I hope to make a fine one. As the marvellous is the most enticing, and the surest guarantee of harmonious numbers, I have been endeavouring to persuade myself to untether Fancy, and to let her manage for herself.[110] I and myself cannot agree about this at all. Wonders are no wonders to me. I am more at home amongst men and women. I would rather read Chaucer than Ariosto. The little dramatic skill I may as yet have, however badly it might show in a drama, would, I think, be sufficient for a poem. I wish to diffuse the colouring of St. Agnes’s Eve throughout a poem in which character and sentiment would be the figures to such drapery. Two or three such poems, if God should spare me, written in the course of the next six years, would be a famous Gradus ad Parnassum altissimum—I mean they would nerve me up to the writing of a few fine plays—my greatest ambition, when I do feel ambitious. I am sorry to say that is very seldom. The subject we have once or twice talked of appears a promising one—The Earl of Leicester’s history. I am this morning reading Holinshed’s “Elizabeth.” You had some books a while ago, you promised to send me, illustrative of my subject. If you can lay hold of them, or any others which may be serviceable to me, I know you will encourage my low-spirited muse by sending[Pg 334] them, or rather by letting me know where our errand-cart man shall call with my little box. I will endeavour to set myself selfishly at work on this poem that is to be.

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





CXXVI.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wednesday Morn—[November 17, 1819].

My dear Fanny—I received your letter yesterday Evening and will obey it to-morrow. I would come to-day—but I have been to Town so frequently on George’s Business it makes me wish to employ to-day at Hampstead. So I say Thursday without fail. I have no news at all entertaining—and if I had I should not have time to tell them as I wish to send this by the morning Post.

Your affectionate Brother
John.





CXXVII.—TO JOSEPH SEVERN.
Wentworth Place, Monday Morn—
[December 6? 1819].

My dear Severn—I am very sorry that on Tuesday I have an appointment in the City of an undeferable nature; and Brown on the same day has some business at Guildhall. I have not been able to figure your manner of executing the Cave of despair,[111] therefore it will be at any rate a novelty and surprise to me—I trust on the right side. I shall call upon you some morning shortly, early enough to catch you before you can get out—when we will proceed to the Academy. I think you must be suited with a good painting light in your Bay window. I wish you to return the Compliment by going with me to see a Poem I have hung up for the Prize in the Lecture Room of the Surry Institution. I have many Rivals,[Pg 335] the most threatening are An Ode to Lord Castlereagh, and a new series of Hymns for the New, new Jerusalem Chapel. (You had best put me into your Cave of despair.)

Ever yours sincerely
John Keats.





CXXVIII.—TO JAMES RICE.
Wentworth Place [December 1819].

My dear Rice—As I want the coat on my back mended, I would be obliged if you would send me the one Brown left at your house by the Bearer—During your late contest I had regular reports of you, how that your time was completely taken up and your health improving—I shall call in the course of a few days, and see whether your promotion has made any difference in your Behaviour to us. I suppose Reynolds has given you an account of Brown and Elliston. As he has not rejected our Tragedy, I shall not venture to call him directly a fool; but as he wishes to put it off till next season, I cannot help thinking him little better than a knave.—That it will not be acted this season is yet uncertain. Perhaps we may give it another furbish and try it at Covent Garden. ’Twould do one’s heart good to see Macready in Ludolph. If you do not see me soon it will be from the humour of writing, which I have had for three days continuing. I must say to the Muses what the maid says to the Man—“Take me while the fit is on me.”...

Ever yours sincerely
John Keats.





CXXIX.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, Monday Morn—
[December 20, 1819.]

My dear Fanny—When I saw you last, you ask’d me whether you should see me again before Christmas. You would have seen me if I had been quite well. I have not,[Pg 336] though not unwell enough to have prevented me—not indeed at all—but fearful lest the weather should affect my throat which on exertion or cold continually threatens me.—By the advice of my Doctor I have had a warm great Coat made and have ordered some thick shoes—so furnish’d I shall be with you if it holds a little fine before Christmas day.—I have been very busy since I saw you, especially the last Week, and shall be for some time, in preparing some Poems to come out in the Spring, and also in brightening the interest of our Tragedy.—Of the Tragedy I can give you but news semigood. It is accepted at Drury Lane with a promise of coming out next season: as that will be too long a delay we have determined to get Elliston to bring it out this Season or to transfer it to Covent Garden. This Elliston will not like, as we have every motive to believe that Kean has perceived how suitable the principal Character will be for him. My hopes of success in the literary world are now better than ever. Mr. Abbey, on my calling on him lately, appeared anxious that I should apply myself to something else—He mentioned Tea Brokerage. I supposed he might perhaps mean to give me the Brokerage of his concern which might be executed with little trouble and a good profit; and therefore said I should have no objection to it, especially as at the same time it occurred to me that I might make over the business to George—I questioned him about it a few days after. His mind takes odd turns. When I became a Suitor he became coy. He did not seem so much inclined to serve me. He described what I should have to do in the progress of business. It will not suit me. I have given it up. I have not heard again from George, which rather disappoints me, as I wish to hear before I make any fresh remittance of his property. I received a note from Mrs. Dilke a few days ago inviting me to dine with her on Xmas day which I shall do. Mr. Brown and I go on in our old dog trot of Breakfast, dinner (not tea, for we have left that off), supper, Sleep, Confab, stirring the fire and reading. Whilst I was in[Pg 337] the Country last Summer, Mrs. Bentley tells me, a woman in mourning call’d on me,—and talk’d something of an aunt of ours—I am so careless a fellow I did not enquire, but will particularly: On Tuesday I am going to hear some Schoolboys Speechify on breaking up day—I’ll lay you a pocket piece we shall have “My name is Norval.” I have not yet look’d for the Letter you mention’d as it is mix’d up in a box full of papers—you must tell me, if you can recollect, the subject of it. This moment Bentley brought a Letter from George for me to deliver to Mrs. Wylie—I shall see her and it before I see you. The Direction was in his best hand written with a good Pen and sealed with a Tassie’s Shakspeare such as I gave you—We judge of people’s hearts by their Countenances; may we not judge of Letters in the same way?—if so, the Letter does not contain unpleasant news—Good or bad spirits have an effect on the handwriting. This direction is at least unnervous and healthy. Our Sister is also well, or George would have made strange work with Ks and Ws. The little Baby is well or he would have formed precious vowels and Consonants—He sent off the Letter in a hurry, or the mail bag was rather a warm berth, or he has worn out his Seal, for the Shakspeare’s head is flattened a little. This is close muggy weather as they say at the Ale houses.

I am ever, my dear Sister, yours affectionately
John Keats.





CXXX.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, Wednesday.
[December 22, 1819.]

My dear Fanny—I wrote to you a Letter directed Walthamstow the day before yesterday wherein I promised to see you before Christmas day. I am sorry to say I have been and continue rather unwell, and therefore shall not be able to promise certainly. I have not[Pg 338] seen Mrs. Wylie’s Letter. Excuse my dear Fanny this very shabby note.

Your affectionate Brother
John.





CXXXI.—TO GEORGIANA KEATS.
Thursday, January 13, 1820.

My dear Sister—By the time you receive this your trouble will be over. I wish you knew they were half over. I mean that George is safe in England and in good health.[112] To write to you by him is almost like following one’s own letter in the mail. That it may not be quite so, I will leave common intelligence out of the question, and write wide of him as I can. I fear I must be dull, having had no good-natured flip from Fortune’s finger since I saw you, and no sideway comfort in the success of my friends. I could almost promise that if I had the means I would accompany George back to America, and pay you a visit of a few months. I should not think much of the time, or my absence from my books; or I have no right to think, for I am very idle. But then I ought to be diligent, and at least keep myself within the reach of materials for diligence. Diligence, that I do not mean to say; I should say dreaming over my books, or rather other people’s books. George has promised to bring you to England when the five years have elapsed. I regret very much that I shall not be able to see you before that time, and even then I must hope that your affairs will be in so prosperous a way as to induce you to stop longer. Yours is a hardish fate, to be so divided among your friends and settled among a people you hate. You will find it improve. You have a heart that will take hold of your children; even George’s absence will make things better. His return will banish what must be your greatest sorrow, and at the same time minor ones with it. Robinson Crusoe, when he[Pg 339] saw himself in danger of perishing on the waters, looked back to his island as to the haven of his happiness, and on gaining it once more was more content with his solitude. We smoke George about his little girl. He runs the common-beaten road of every father, as I dare say you do of every mother: there is no child like his child, so original,—original forsooth! However, I take you at your words. I have a lively faith that yours is the very gem of all children. Ain’t I its uncle?

On Henry’s marriage there was a piece of bride cake sent me. It missed its way. I suppose the carrier or coachman was a conjuror, and wanted it for his own private use. Last Sunday George and I dined at Millar’s. There were your mother and Charles with Fool Lacon, Esq., who sent the sly, disinterested shawl to Miss Millar, with his own heathen name engraved in the middle. Charles had a silk handkerchief belonging to a Miss Grover, with whom he pretended to be smitten, and for her sake kept exhibiting and adoring the handkerchief all the evening. Fool Lacon, Esq., treated it with a little venturesome, trembling contumely, whereupon Charles set him quietly down on the floor, from where he as quietly got up. This process was repeated at supper time, when your mother said, “If I were you Mr. Lacon I would not let him do so.” Fool Lacon, Esq., did not offer any remark. He will undoubtedly die in his bed. Your mother did not look quite so well on Sunday. Mrs. Henry Wylie is excessively quiet before people. I hope she is always so. Yesterday we dined at Taylor’s, in Fleet Street. George left early after dinner to go to Deptford; he will make all square there for me. I could not go with him—I did not like the amusement. Haslam is a very good fellow indeed; he has been excessively anxious and kind to us. But is this fair? He has an innamorata at Deptford, and he has been wanting me for some time past to see her. This is a thing which it is impossible not to shirk. A man is like a magnet—he must have a repelling end. So how am I to see[Pg 340] Haslam’s lady and family, if I even went? for by the time I got to Greenwich I should have repell’d them to Blackheath, and by the time I got to Deptford they would be on Shooter’s Hill; when I came to Shooter Hill they would alight at Chatham, and so on till I drove them into the sea, which I think might be indictable. The evening before yesterday we had a pianoforte hop at Dilke’s. There was very little amusement in the room, but a Scotchman to hate. Some people, you must have observed, have a most unpleasant effect upon you when you see them speaking in profile. This Scotchman is the most accomplished fellow in this way I ever met with. The effect was complete. It went down like a dose of bitters, and I hope will improve my digestion. At Taylor’s too, there was a Scotchman,—not quite so bad, for he was as clean as he could get himself. Not having succeeded in Drury Lane with our tragedy, we have been making some alterations, and are about to try Covent Garden. Brown has just done patching up the copy—as it is altered. The reliance I had on it was in Kean’s acting. I am not afraid it will be damn’d in the Garden. You said in one of your letters that there was nothing but Haydon and Co. in mine. There can be nothing of him in this, for I never see him or Co. George has introduced to us an American of the name of Hart. I like him in a moderate way. He was at Mrs. Dilke’s party—and sitting by me; we began talking about English and American ladies. The Miss —— and some of their friends made not a very enticing row opposite us. I bade him mark them and form his judgment of them. I told him I hated Englishmen because they were the only men I knew. He does not understand this. Who would be Braggadochio to Johnny Bull? Johnny’s house is his castle—and a precious dull castle it is; what a many Bull castles there are in so-and-so crescent! I never wish myself an unversed writer and newsmonger but when I write to you. I should like for a day or two to have somebody’s knowledge—Mr.[Pg 341] Lacon’s for instance—of all the different folks of a wide acquaintance, to tell you about. Only let me have his knowledge of family minutiæ and I would set them in a proper light; but, bless me, I never go anywhere. My pen is no more garrulous than my tongue. Any third person would think I was addressing myself to a lover of scandal. But we know we do not love scandal, but fun; and if scandal happens to be fun, that is no fault of ours. There were very good pickings for me in George’s letters about the prairie settlement, if I had any taste to turn them to account in England. I knew a friend of Miss Andrews, yet I never mentioned her to him; for after I had read the letter I really did not recollect her story. Now I have been sitting here half an hour with my invention at work, to say something about your mother or Charles or Henry, but it is in vain. I know not what to say. Three nights since, George went with your mother to the play. I hope she will soon see mine acted. I do not remember ever to have thanked you for your tassels to my Shakspeare—there he hangs so ably supported opposite me. I thank you now. It is a continual memento of you. If you should have a boy, do not christen him John, and persuade George not to let his partiality for me come across. ’Tis a bad name, and goes against a man. If my name had been Edmund I should have been more fortunate.

I was surprised to hear of the state of society at Louisville; it seems to me you are just as ridiculous there as we are here—threepenny parties, halfpenny dances. The best thing I have heard of is your shooting; for it seems you follow the gun. Give my compliments to Mrs. Audubon, and tell her I cannot think her either good-looking or honest. Tell Mr. Audubon he’s a fool, and Briggs that ’tis well I was not Mr. A.


Saturday, January 15.

It is strange that George having to stop so short a time in England, I should not have seen him for[Pg 342] nearly two days. He has been to Haslam’s and does not encourage me to follow his example. He had given promise to dine with the same party to-morrow, but has sent an excuse which I am glad of, as we shall have a pleasant party with us to-morrow. We expect Charles here to-day. This is a beautiful day. I hope you will not quarrel with it if I call it an American one. The sun comes upon the snow and makes a prettier candy than we have on twelfth-night cakes. George is busy this morning in making copies of my verses. He is making one now of an “Ode to the Nightingale,” which is like reading an account of the Black Hole at Calcutta on an iceberg.

You will say this is a matter of course. I am glad it is—I mean that I should like your brothers more the more I know them. I should spend much more time with them if our lives were more run in parallel; but we can talk but on one subject—that is you.

The more I know of men the more I know how to value entire liberality in any of them. Thank God, there are a great many who will sacrifice their worldly interest for a friend. I wish there were more who would sacrifice their passions. The worst of men are those whose self-interests are their passion; the next, those whose passions are their self-interest. Upon the whole I dislike mankind. Whatever people on the other side of the question may advance, they cannot deny that they are always surprised at hearing of a good action, and never of a bad one. I am glad you have something to like in America—doves. Gertrude of Wyoming and Birkbeck’s book should be bound up together like a brace of decoy ducks—one is almost as poetical as the other. Precious miserable people at the prairie. I have been sitting in the sun whilst I wrote this till it’s become quite oppressive—this is very odd for January. The vulcan fire is the true natural heat for winter. The sun has nothing to do in winter but to give a little glooming light much like a shade. Our Irish servant has piqued[Pg 343] me this morning by saying that her father in Ireland was very much like my Shakspeare, only he had more colour than the engraving. You will find on George’s return that I have not been neglecting your affairs. The delay was unfortunate, not faulty. Perhaps by this time you have received my three last letters, not one of which had reached before George sailed. I would give twopence to have been over the world as much as he has. I wish I had money enough to do nothing but travel about for years. Were you now in England I dare say you would be able (setting aside the pleasure you would have in seeing your mother) to suck out more amusement for society than I am able to do. To me it is all as dull here as Louisville could be. I am tired of the theatres. Almost all the parties I may chance to fall into I know by heart. I know the different styles of talk in different places,—what subjects will be started, how it will proceed like an acted play, from the first to the last act. If I go to Hunt’s I run my head into many tunes heard before, old puns, and old music; to Haydon’s worn-out discourses of poetry and painting. The Miss —— I am afraid to speak to, for fear of some sickly reiteration of phrase or sentiment. When they were at the dance the other night I tried manfully to sit near and talk to them, but to no purpose; and if I had it would have been to no purpose still. My question or observation must have been an old one, and the rejoinder very antique indeed. At Dilke’s I fall foul of politics. ’Tis best to remain aloof from people and like their good parts without being eternally troubled with the dull process of their everyday lives. When once a person has smoked the vapidness of the routine of society he must either have self-interest or the love of some sort of distinction to keep him in good humour with it. All I can say is that, standing at Charing Cross and looking east, west, north, and south, I can see nothing but dulness. I hope while I am young to live retired in the country. When I grow in years and have a right to be idle, I shall enjoy[Pg 344] cities more. If the American ladies are worse than the English they must be very bad. You say you should like your Emily brought up here. You had better bring her up yourself. You know a good number of English ladies; what encomium could you give of half a dozen of them? The greater part seem to me downright American. I have known more than one Mrs. Audubon. Her affectation of fashion and politeness cannot transcend ours. Look at our Cheapside tradesmen’s sons and daughters—only fit to be taken off by a plague. I hope now soon to come to the time when I shall never be forced to walk through the city and hate as I walk.

Monday, January 17.

George had a quick rejoinder to his letter of excuse to Haslam, so we had not his company yesterday, which I was sorry for as there was our old set. I know three witty people all distinct in their excellence—Rice, Reynolds, and Richards. Rice is the wisest, Reynolds the playfullest, Richards the out-o’-the-wayest. The first makes you laugh and think, the second makes you laugh and not think, the third puzzles your head. I admire the first, I enjoy the second, I stare at the third. The first is claret, the second ginger-beer, the third crême de Byrapymdrag. The first is inspired by Minerva, the second by Mercury, the third by Harlequin Epigram, Esq. The first is neat in his dress, the second slovenly, the third uncomfortable. The first speaks adagio, the second allegretto, the third both together. The first is Swiftean, the second Tom-Crib-ean, the third Shandean. And yet these three eans are not three eans but one ean.

Charles came on Saturday but went early; he seems to have schemes and plans and wants to get off. He is quite right; I am glad to see him employed at business. You remember I wrote you a story about a woman named Alice being made young again, or some such stuff. In your next letter tell me whether I gave it as my own, or whether I gave it as a matter Brown was employed upon[Pg 345] at the time. He read it over to George the other day, and George said he had heard it all before. So Brown suspects I have been giving you his story as my own. I should like to set him right in it by your evidence. George has not returned from town; when he does I shall tax his memory. We had a young, long, raw, lean Scotchman with us yesterday, called Thornton. Rice, for fun or for mistake, would persist in calling him Stevenson. I know three people of no wit at all, each distinct in his excellence—A, B, and C. A is the foolishest, B the sulkiest, C is a negative. A makes you yawn, B makes you hate, as for C you never see him at all though he were six feet high—I bear the first, I forbear the second, I am not certain that the third is. The first is gruel, the second ditch-water, the third is spilt—he ought to be wip’d up. A is inspired by Jack-o’-the-clock, B has been drilled by a Russian serjeant, C, they say, is not his mother’s true child, but she bought him of the man who cries, Young lambs to sell.

Twang-dillo-dee—This you must know is the amen to nonsense. I know a good many places where Amen should be scratched out, rubbed over with ponce made of Momus’s little finger bones, and in its place Twang-dillo-dee written. This is the word I shall be tempted to write at the end of most modern poems. Every American book ought to have it. It would be a good distinction in society. My Lords Wellington and Castlereagh, and Canning, and many more, would do well to wear Twang-dillo-dee on their backs instead of Ribbons at their button-holes; how many people would go sideways along walls and quickset hedges to keep their “Twang-dillo-dee” out of sight, or wear large pig-tails to hide it. However there would be so many that the Twang-dillo-dees would keep one another in countenance—which Brown cannot do for me—I have fallen away lately. Thieves and murderers would gain rank in the world, for would any of them have the poorness of spirit to condescend to be a Twang-dillo-dee? “I have robbed[Pg 346] many a dwelling house; I have killed many a fowl, many a goose, and many a Man (would such a gentleman say) but, thank Heaven, I was never yet a Twang-dillo-dee.” Some philosophers in the moon, who spy at our globe as we do at theirs, say that Twang-dillo-dee is written in large letters on our globe of earth; they say the beginning of the “T” is just on the spot where London stands, London being built within the flourish; “wan” reaches downward and slants as far as Timbuctoo in Africa; the tail of the “g” goes slap across the Atlantic into the Rio della Plata; the remainder of the letters wrap around New Holland, and the last “e” terminates in land we have not yet discovered. However, I must be silent; these are dangerous times to libel a man in—much more a world.


Friday 27 [for 28th January 1820].

I wish you would call me names: I deserve them so much. I have only written two sheets for you, to carry by George, and those I forgot to bring to town and have therefore to forward them to Liverpool. George went this morning at 6 o’clock by the Liverpool coach. His being on his journey to you prevents my regretting his short stay. I have no news of any sort to tell you. Henry is wife bound in Camden Town; there is no getting him out. I am sorry he has not a prettier wife: indeed ’tis a shame: she is not half a wife. I think I could find some of her relations in Buffon, or Captn Cook’s voyages or the hierogueglyphics in Moor’s Almanack, or upon a Chinese clock door, the shepherdesses on her own mantelpiece, or in a cruel sampler in which she may find herself worsted, or in a Dutch toyshop window, or one of the daughters in the ark, or any picture shop window. As I intend to retire into the country where there will be no sort of news, I shall not be able to write you very long letters. Besides I am afraid the postage comes to too much; which till now I have not been aware of.

People in military bands are generally seriously [Pg 347]occupied. None may or can laugh at their work but the Kettle Drum, Long Drum, Do. Triangle and Cymbals. Thinking you might want a rat-catcher I put your mother’s old quaker-colour’d cat into the top of your bonnet. She’s wi’ kitten, so you may expect to find a whole family. I hope the family will not grow too large for its lodging. I shall send you a close written sheet on the first of next month, but for fear of missing the Liverpool Post I must finish here. God bless you and your little girl.

Your affectionate Brother
John Keats.





CXXXII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, Sunday Morning.
[February 6, 1820.]

My dear Sister—I should not have sent those Letters without some notice if Mr. Brown had not persuaded me against it on account of an illness with which I was attack’d on Thursday.[113] After that I was resolved not to write till I should be on the mending hand; thank God, I am now so. From imprudently leaving off my great coat in the thaw I caught cold which flew to my Lungs. Every remedy that has been applied has taken the desired effect, and I have nothing now to do but stay within doors for some time. If I should be confined long I shall write to Mr. Abbey to ask permission for you to visit me. George has been running great chance of a similar attack, but I hope the sea air will be his Physician in case of illness—the air out at sea is always more temperate than on land—George mentioned, in his Letters to us, something of Mr. Abbey’s regret concerning the silence kept up in his house. It is entirely the fault of his Manner.[Pg 348] You must be careful always to wear warm clothing not only in frost but in a Thaw.—I have no news to tell you. The half-built houses opposite us stand just as they were and seem dying of old age before they are brought up. The grass looks very dingy, the Celery is all gone, and there is nothing to enliven one but a few Cabbage Stalks that seem fix’d on the superannuated List. Mrs. Dilke has been ill but is better. Several of my friends have been to see me. Mrs. Reynolds was here this morning and the two Mr. Wylie’s. Brown has been very alert about me, though a little wheezy himself this weather. Everybody is ill. Yesterday evening Mr. Davenport, a gentleman of Hampstead, sent me an invitation to supper, instead of his coming to see us, having so bad a cold he could not stir out—so you see ’tis the weather and I am among a thousand. Whenever you have an inflammatory fever never mind about eating. The day on which I was getting ill I felt this fever to a great height, and therefore almost entirely abstained from food the whole day. I have no doubt experienced a benefit from so doing—The Papers I see are full of anecdotes of the late King: how he nodded to a Coal-heaver and laugh’d with a Quaker and lik’d boiled Leg of Mutton. Old Peter Pindar is just dead: what will the old King and he say to each other? Perhaps the King may confess that Peter was in the right, and Peter maintain himself to have been wrong. You shall hear from me again on Tuesday.

Your affectionate Brother
John.





CXXXIII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, Tuesday Morn.
[February 8, 1820.]

My dear Fanny—I had a slight return of fever last night, which terminated favourably, and I am now tolerably well, though weak from the small quantity of food to which I am obliged to confine myself: I am sure a[Pg 349] mouse would starve upon it. Mrs. Wylie came yesterday. I have a very pleasant room for a sick person. A Sofa bed is made up for me in the front Parlour which looks on to the grass plot as you remember Mrs. Dilke’s does. How much more comfortable than a dull room up stairs, where one gets tired of the pattern of the bed curtains. Besides I see all that passes—for instance now, this morning—if I had been in my own room I should not have seen the coals brought in. On Sunday between the hours of twelve and one I descried a Pot boy. I conjectured it might be the one o’Clock beer—Old women with bobbins and red cloaks and unpresuming bonnets I see creeping about the heath. Gipsies after hare skins and silver spoons. Then goes by a fellow with a wooden clock under his arm that strikes a hundred and more. Then comes the old French emigrant (who has been very well to do in France) with his hands joined behind on his hips, and his face full of political schemes. Then passes Mr. David Lewis, a very good-natured, good-looking old gentleman who has been very kind to Tom and George and me. As for those fellows the Brickmakers they are always passing to and fro. I mus’n’t forget the two old maiden Ladies in Well Walk who have a Lap dog between them that they are very anxious about. It is a corpulent Little beast whom it is necessary to coax along with an ivory-tipp’d cane. Carlo our Neighbour Mrs. Brawne’s dog and it meet sometimes. Lappy thinks Carlo a devil of a fellow and so do his Mistresses. Well they may—he would sweep ’em all down at a run; all for the Joke of it. I shall desire him to peruse the fable of the Boys and the frogs: though he prefers the tongues and the Bones. You shall hear from me again the day after to-morrow.

Your affectionate Brother
John Keats.





[Pg 350]

CXXXIV.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place [February 11, 1820].

My dear Fanny—I am much the same as when I last wrote. I hope a little more verging towards improvement. Yesterday morning being very fine, I took a walk for a quarter of an hour in the garden and was very much refresh’d by it. You must consider no news, good news—if you do not hear from me the day after to-morrow.

Your affectionate Brother
John.





CXXXV.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, Monday Morn.
[February 14, 1820.]

My dear Fanny—I am improving but very gradually and suspect it will be a long while before I shall be able to walk six miles—The Sun appears half inclined to shine; if he obliges us I shall take a turn in the garden this morning. No one from Town has visited me since my last. I have had so many presents of jam and jellies that they would reach side by side the length of the sideboard. I hope I shall be well before it is all consumed. I am vexed that Mr. Abbey will not allow you pocket money sufficient. He has not behaved well—By detaining money from me and George when we most wanted it he has increased our expenses. In consequence of such delay George was obliged to take his voyage to England which will be £150 out of his pocket. I enclose you a note—You shall hear from me again the day after to-morrow.

Your affectionate Brother
John.





CXXXVI.—TO JAMES RICE.
Wentworth Place, February 16, 1820.

My dear Rice—I have not been well enough to make any tolerable rejoinder to your kind letter. I will, as you[Pg 351] advise, be very chary of my health and spirits. I am sorry to hear of your relapse and hypochondriac symptoms attending it. Let us hope for the best, as you say. I shall follow your example in looking to the future good rather than brooding upon the present ill. I have not been so worn with lengthened illnesses as you have, therefore cannot answer you on your own ground with respect to those haunting and deformed thoughts and feelings you speak of. When I have been, or supposed myself in health, I have had my share of them, especially within the last year. I may say, that for six months before I was taken ill I had not passed a tranquil day. Either that gloom overspread me, or I was suffering under some passionate feeling, or if I turned to versify, that acerbated the poison of either sensation. The beauties of nature had lost their power over me. How astonishingly (here I must premise that illness, as far as I can judge in so short a time, has relieved my mind of a load of deceptive thoughts and images, and makes me perceive things in a truer light),—how astonishingly does the chance of leaving the world impress a sense of its natural beauties upon us! Like poor Falstaff, though I do not “babble,” I think of green fields; I muse with the greatest affection on every flower I have known from my infancy—their shapes and colours are as new to me as if I had just created them with a superhuman fancy. It is because they are connected with the most thoughtless and the happiest moments of our lives. I have seen foreign flowers in hothouses, of the most beautiful nature, but I do not care a straw for them. The simple flowers of our Spring are what I want to see again.

Brown has left the inventive and taken to the imitative art. He is doing his forte, which is copying Hogarth’s heads. He has just made a purchase of the Methodist Meeting picture, which gave me a horrid dream a few nights ago. I hope I shall sit under the trees with you again in some such place as the Isle of Wight. I do not mind a game of cards in a saw-pit or[Pg 352] waggon, but if ever you catch me on a stage-coach in the winter full against the wind, bring me down with a brace of bullets, and I promise not to ’peach. Remember me to Reynolds, and say how much I should like to hear from him; that Brown returned immediately after he went on Sunday, and that I was vexed at forgetting to ask him to lunch; for as he went towards the gate, I saw he was fatigued and hungry.

I am, my dear Rice, ever most sincerely yours
John Keats.

I have broken this open to let you know I was surprised at seeing it on the table this morning, thinking it had gone long ago.





CXXXVII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
[February 19, 1820.]

My dear Fanny—Being confined almost entirely to vegetable food and the weather being at the same time so much against me, I cannot say I have much improved since I wrote last. The Doctor tells me there are no dangerous Symptoms about me, and quietness of mind and fine weather will restore me. Mind my advice to be very careful to wear warm cloathing in a thaw. I will write again on Tuesday when I hope to send you good news.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





CXXXVIII.—TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS.
[February 23 or 25, 1820.]

My dear Reynolds—I have been improving since you saw me: my nights are better which I think is a very encouraging thing. You mention your cold in rather too slighting a manner—if you travel outside have some flannel against the wind—which I hope will not keep on[Pg 353] at this rate when you are in the Packet boat. Should it rain do not stop upon deck though the Passengers should vomit themselves inside out. Keep under Hatches from all sort of wet.

I am pretty well provided with Books at present, when you return I may give you a commission or two. Mr. B. C. has sent me not only his Sicilian Story but yesterday his Dramatic Scenes—this is very polite, and I shall do what I can to make him sensible I think so. I confess they teaze me—they are composed of amiability, the Seasons, the Leaves, the Moons, etc., upon which he rings (according to Hunt’s expression), triple bob majors. However that is nothing—I think he likes poetry for its own sake, not his. I hope I shall soon be well enough to proceed with my faeries and set you about the notes on Sundays and Stray-days. If I had been well enough I should have liked to cross the water with you. Brown wishes you a pleasant voyage—Have fish for dinner at the sea ports, and don’t forget a bottle of Claret. You will not meet with so much to hate at Brussels as at Paris. Remember me to all my friends. If I were well enough I would paraphrase an ode of Horace’s for you, on your embarking in the seventy years ago style. The Packet will bear a comparison with a Roman galley at any rate.

Ever yours affectionately
J. Keats.





CXXXIX.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, Thursday.
[February 24, 1820.]

My dear Fanny—I am sorry to hear you have been so unwell: now you are better, keep so. Remember to be very careful of your clothing—this climate requires the utmost care. There has been very little alteration in me lately. I am much the same as when I wrote last. When I am well enough to return to my old diet I shall get stronger. If my recovery should be delay’d[Pg 354] long I will ask Mr. Abbey to let you visit me—keep up your Spirits as well as you can. You shall hear soon again from me.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





CXL.—TO CHARLES WENTWORTH DILKE.
[Hampstead, March 4, 1820.]

My dear Dilke—Since I saw you I have been gradually, too gradually perhaps, improving; and though under an interdict with respect to animal food, living upon pseudo victuals, Brown says I have pick’d up a little flesh lately. If I can keep off inflammation for the next six weeks I trust I shall do very well. You certainly should have been at Martin’s dinner, for making an index is surely as dull work as engraving. Have you heard that the Bookseller is going to tie himself to the manger eat or not as he pleases. He says Rice shall have his foot on the fender notwithstanding. Reynolds is going to sail on the salt seas. Brown has been mightily progressing with his Hogarth. A damn’d melancholy picture it is, and during the first week of my illness it gave me a psalm-singing nightmare, that made me almost faint away in my sleep. I know I am better, for I can bear the Picture. I have experienced a specimen of great politeness from Mr. Barry Cornwall. He has sent me his books. Some time ago he had given his first publish’d book to Hunt for me; Hunt forgot to give it and Barry Cornwall thinking I had received it must have thought me a very neglectful fellow. Notwithstanding he sent me his second book and on my explaining that I had not received his first he sent me that also. I am sorry to see by Mrs. D.’s note that she has been so unwell with the spasms. Does she continue the Medicines that benefited her so much? I am afraid not. Remember me to her, and say I shall not expect her at Hampstead next week unless the Weather changes for the warmer. It is better to run no chance of a[Pg 355] supernumerary cold in March. As for you, you must come. You must improve in your penmanship; your writing is like the speaking of a child of three years old, very understandable to its father but to no one else. The worst is it looks well—no, that is not the worst—the worst is, it is worse than Bailey’s. Bailey’s looks illegible and may perchance be read; yours looks very legible and may perchance not be read. I would endeavour to give you a fac-simile of your word Thistlewood if I were not minded on the instant that Lord Chesterfield has done some such thing to his son. Now I would not bathe in the same River with Lord C. though I had the upper hand of the stream. I am grieved that in writing and speaking it is necessary to make use of the same particles as he did. Cobbett is expected to come in. O that I had two double plumpers for him. The ministry are not so inimical to him but it would like to put him out of Coventry. Casting my eye on the other side I see a long word written in a most vile manner, unbecoming a Critic. You must recollect I have served no apprenticeship to old plays. If the only copies of the Greek and Latin authors had been made by you, Bailey and Haydon they were as good as lost. It has been said that the Character of a Man may be known by his handwriting—if the Character of the age may be known by the average goodness of said, what a slovenly age we live in. Look at Queen Elizabeth’s Latin exercises and blush. Look at Milton’s hand. I can’t say a word for Shakspeare’s.

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





CXLI.—TO FANNY KEATS.
[March 20, 1820.]

My dear Fanny—According to your desire I write to-day. It must be but a few lines, for I have been attack’d several times with a palpitation at the heart and the Doctor says I must not make the slightest [Pg 356]exertion. I am much the same to-day as I have been for a week past. They say ’tis nothing but debility and will entirely cease on my recovery of my strength which is the object of my present diet. As the Doctor will not suffer me to write I shall ask Mr. Brown to let you hear news of me for the future if I should not get stronger soon. I hope I shall be well enough to come and see your flowers in bloom.

Ever your most affectionate Brother
John ——.





CXLII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, April 1 [1820].

My dear Fanny—I am getting better every day and should think myself quite well were I not reminded every now and then by faintness and a tightness in the Chest. Send your Spaniel over to Hampstead, for I think I know where to find a Master or Mistress for him. You may depend upon it if you were even to turn it loose in the common road it would soon find an owner. If I keep improving as I have done I shall be able to come over to you in the course of a few weeks. I should take the advantage of your being in Town but I cannot bear the City though I have already ventured as far as the west end for the purpose of seeing Mr. Haydon’s Picture, which is just finished and has made its appearance. I have not heard from George yet since he left Liverpool. Mr. Brown wrote to him as from me the other day—Mr. B. wrote two Letters to Mr. Abbey concerning me—Mr. A. took no notice and of course Mr. B. must give up such a correspondence when as the man said all the Letters are on one side. I write with greater ease than I had thought, therefore you shall soon hear from me again.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





[Pg 357]

CXLIII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
[April 1820.]

My dear Fanny—Mr. Brown is waiting for me to take a walk. Mrs. Dilke is on a visit next door and desires her love to you. The Dog shall be taken care of and for his name I shall go and look in the parish register where he was born—I still continue on the mending hand.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





CXLIV.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, April 12 [1820].

My dear Fanny—Excuse these shabby scraps of paper I send you—and also from endeavouring to give you any consolation just at present, for though my health is tolerably well I am too nervous to enter into any discussion in which my heart is concerned. Wait patiently and take care of your health, being especially careful to keep yourself from low spirits which are great enemies to health. You are young and have only need of a little patience. I am not yet able to bear the fatigue of coming to Walthamstow, though I have been to Town once or twice. I have thought of taking a change of air. You shall hear from me immediately on my moving anywhere. I will ask Mrs. Dilke to pay you a visit if the weather holds fine, the first time I see her. The Dog is being attended to like a Prince.

Your affectionate Brother
John.





CXLV.—TO FANNY KEATS.
[Hampstead, April 21, 1820.]

My dear Fanny—I have been slowly improving since I wrote last. The Doctor assures me that there is nothing the matter with me except nervous irritability[Pg 358] and a general weakness of the whole system, which has proceeded from my anxiety of mind of late years and the too great excitement of poetry. Mr. Brown is going to Scotland by the Smack, and I am advised for change of exercise and air to accompany him and give myself the chance of benefit from a Voyage. Mr. H. Wylie call’d on me yesterday with a letter from George to his mother: George is safe at the other side of the water, perhaps by this time arrived at his home. I wish you were coming to town that I might see you; if you should be coming write to me, as it is quite a trouble to get by the coaches to Walthamstow. Should you not come to Town I must see you before I sail, at Walthamstow. They tell me I must study lines and tangents and squares and angles to put a little Ballast into my mind. We shall be going in a fortnight and therefore you will see me within that space. I expected sooner, but I have not been able to venture to walk across the country. Now the fine Weather is come you will not find your time so irksome. You must be sensible how much I regret not being able to alleviate the unpleasantness of your situation, but trust my dear Fanny that better times are in wait for you.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





CXLVI.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, Thursday [May 4, 1820].

My dear Fanny—I went for the first time into the City the day before yesterday, for before I was very disinclined to encounter the scuffle, more from nervousness than real illness; which notwithstanding I should not have suffered to conquer me if I had not made up my mind not to go to Scotland, but to remove to Kentish Town till Mr. Brown returns. Kentish Town is a mile nearer to you than Hampstead—I have been getting gradually better, but am not so well as to trust myself to the casualties of rain and sleeping out which I am[Pg 359] liable to in visiting you. Mr. Brown goes on Saturday, and by that time I shall have settled in my new lodging, when I will certainly venture to you. You will forgive me I hope when I confess that I endeavour to think of you as little as possible and to let George dwell upon my mind but slightly. The reason being that I am afraid to ruminate on anything which has the shade of difficulty or melancholy in it, as that sort of cogitation is so pernicious to health, and it is only by health that I can be enabled to alleviate your situation in future. For some time you must do what you can of yourself for relief; and bear your mind up with the consciousness that your situation cannot last for ever, and that for the present you may console yourself against the reproaches of Mrs. Abbey. Whatever obligations you may have had to her you have none now, as she has reproached you. I do not know what property you have, but I will enquire into it: be sure however that beyond the obligation that a lodger may have to a landlord you have none to Mrs. Abbey. Let the surety of this make you laugh at Mrs. A.’s foolish tattle. Mrs. Dilke’s Brother has got your Dog. She is now very well—still liable to Illness. I will get her to come and see you if I can make up my mind on the propriety of introducing a stranger into Abbey’s house. Be careful to let no fretting injure your health as I have suffered it—health is the greatest of blessings—with health and hope we should be content to live, and so you will find as you grow older.

I am, my dear Fanny, your affectionate Brother
John ——.





CXLVII.—TO CHARLES WENTWORTH DILKE.
[Hampstead, May 1820].

My dear Dilke—As Brown is not to be a fixture at Hampstead, I have at last made up my mind to send home all lent books. I should have seen you before this, but my mind has been at work all over the world to find[Pg 360] out what to do. I have my choice of three things, or at least two,—South America, or Surgeon to an Indiaman, which last, I think, will be my fate. I shall resolve in a few days. Remember me to Mrs. D. and Charles, and your father and mother.

Ever truly yours
John Keats.





CXLVIII.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
[Wesleyan Place, Kentish Town][114]
June 11 [1820].

My dear Taylor—In reading over the proof of St. Agnes’s Eve since I left Fleet Street, I was struck with what appears to me an alteration in the seventh stanza very much for the worse. The passage I mean stands thus—

her maiden eyes incline
Still on the floor, while many a sweeping train
Pass by.

’Twas originally written—

her maiden eyes divine
Fix’d on the floor, saw many a sweeping train
Pass by.

My meaning is quite destroyed in the alteration. I do not use train for concourse of passers by, but for skirts sweeping along the floor.

In the first stanza my copy reads, second line—

bitter chill it was,

to avoid the echo cold in the second line.

Ever yours sincerely
John Keats.





CXLIX.—TO CHARLES BROWN.
[Wesleyan Place, Kentish Town, June 1820.]

My dear Brown—I have only been to ——’s once since you left, when —— could not find your letters. Now[Pg 361] this is bad of me. I should, in this instance, conquer the great aversion to breaking up my regular habits, which grows upon me more and more. True, I have an excuse in the weather, which drives one from shelter to shelter in any little excursion. I have not heard from George. My book is coming out with very low hopes, though not spirits, on my part. This shall be my last trial; not succeeding, I shall try what I can do in the apothecary line. When you hear from or see ---- it is probable you will hear some complaints against me, which this notice is not intended to forestall. The fact is, I did behave badly; but it is to be attributed to my health, spirits, and the disadvantageous ground I stand on in society. I could go and accommodate matters if I were not too weary of the world. I know that they are more happy and comfortable than I am; therefore why should I trouble myself about it? I foresee I shall know very few people in the course of a year or two. Men get such different habits that they become as oil and vinegar to one another. Thus far I have a consciousness of having been pretty dull and heavy, both in subject and phrase; I might add, enigmatical. I am in the wrong, and the world is in the right, I have no doubt. Fact is, I have had so many kindnesses done me by so many people, that I am cheveaux-de-frised with benefits, which I must jump over or break down. I met —— in town, a few days ago, who invited me to supper to meet Wordsworth, Southey, Lamb, Haydon, and some more; I was too careful of my health to risk being out at night. Talking of that, I continue to improve slowly, but I think surely. There is a famous exhibition in Pall-Mall of the old English portraits by Vandyck and Holbein, Sir Peter Lely, and the great Sir Godfrey. Pleasant countenances predominate; so I will mention two or three unpleasant ones. There is James the First, whose appearance would disgrace a “Society for the Suppression of Women;” so very squalid and subdued to nothing he looks. Then, there is old Lord Burleigh, the high-priest of economy,[Pg 362] the political save-all, who has the appearance of a Pharisee just rebuffed by a Gospel bon-mot. Then, there is George the Second, very like an unintellectual Voltaire, troubled with the gout and a bad temper. Then, there is young Devereux, the favourite, with every appearance of as slang a boxer as any in the Court; his face is cast in the mould of blackguardism with jockey-plaster. I shall soon begin upon “Lucy Vaughan Lloyd.”[115] I do not begin composition yet, being willing, in case of a relapse, to have nothing to reproach myself with. I hope the weather will give you the slip; let it show itself and steal out of your company. When I have sent off this, I shall write another to some place about fifty miles in advance of you.

Good morning to you. Yours ever sincerely
John Keats.





CL.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Friday Morn [Wesleyan Place, Kentish Town,
June 26, 1820.]

My dear Fanny—I had intended to delay seeing you till a Book which I am now publishing was out,[116] expecting that to be the end of this week when I would have brought it to Walthamstow: on receiving your Letter of course I set myself to come to town, but was not able, for just as I was setting out yesterday morning a slight spitting of blood came on which returned rather more copiously at night. I have slept well and they tell me there is nothing material to fear. I will send my Book soon with a Letter which I have had from George who is with his family quite well.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





[Pg 363]

CLI.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Mortimer Terrace,[117] Wednesday [July 5, 1820].

My dear Fanny—I have had no return of the spitting of blood, and for two or three days have been getting a little stronger. I have no hopes of an entire re-establishment of my health under some months of patience. My Physician tells me I must contrive to pass the Winter in Italy. This is all very unfortunate for us—we have no recourse but patience, which I am now practising better than ever I thought it possible for me. I have this moment received a Letter from Mr. Brown, dated Dunvegan Castle, Island of Skye. He is very well in health and spirits. My new publication has been out for some days and I have directed a Copy to be bound for you, which you will receive shortly. No one can regret Mr. Hodgkinson’s ill fortune: I must own illness has not made such a Saint of me as to prevent my rejoicing at his reverse. Keep yourself in as good hopes as possible; in case my illness should continue an unreasonable time many of my friends would I trust for my sake do all in their power to console and amuse you, at the least word from me—You may depend upon it that in case my strength returns I will do all in my power to extricate you from the Abbeys. Be above all things careful of your health which is the corner stone of all pleasure.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





CLII.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
[Mortimer Terrace, July 1820.]

My dear Haydon—I am sorry to be obliged to try your patience a few more days when you will have the Book[118] sent from Town. I am glad to hear you are in[Pg 364] progress with another Picture. Go on. I am afraid I shall pop off just when my mind is able to run alone.

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





CLIII.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Mortimer Terrace [July 22, 1820].

My dear Fanny—I have been gaining strength for some days: it would be well if I could at the same time say I am gaining hopes of a speedy recovery. My constitution has suffered very much for two or three years past, so as to be scarcely able to make head against illness, which the natural activity and impatience of my Mind renders more dangerous. It will at all events be a very tedious affair, and you must expect to hear very little alteration of any sort in me for some time. You ought to have received a copy of my Book ten days ago. I shall send another message to the Booksellers. One of the Mr. Wylie’s will be here to-day or to-morrow when I will ask him to send you George’s Letter. Writing the smallest note is so annoying to me that I have waited till I shall see him. Mr. Hunt does everything in his power to make the time pass as agreeably with me as possible. I read the greatest part of the day, and generally take two half-hour walks a-day up and down the terrace which is very much pester’d with cries, ballad singers, and street music. We have been so unfortunate for so long a time, every event has been of so depressing a nature that I must persuade myself to think some change will take place in the aspect of our affairs. I shall be upon the look out for a trump card.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





CLIV.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place [August 14, 1820].

My dear Fanny—’Tis a long time since I received your last. An accident of an unpleasant nature occurred[Pg 365] at Mr. Hunt’s and prevented me from answering you, that is to say made me nervous. That you may not suppose it worse I will mention that some one of Mr. Hunt’s household opened a Letter of mine—upon which I immediately left Mortimer Terrace, with the intention of taking to Mrs. Bentley’s again; fortunately I am not in so lone a situation, but am staying a short time with Mrs. Brawne who lives in the house which was Mrs. Dilke’s. I am excessively nervous: a person I am not quite used to entering the room half chokes me. ’Tis not yet Consumption I believe, but it would be were I to remain in this climate all the Winter: so I am thinking of either voyaging or travelling to Italy. Yesterday I received an invitation from Mr. Shelley, a Gentleman residing at Pisa, to spend the Winter with him: if I go I must be away in a month or even less. I am glad you like the Poems, you must hope with me that time and health will produce you some more. This is the first morning I have been able to sit to the paper and have many Letters to write if I can manage them. God bless you my dear Sister.

Your affectionate Brother
John ——.





CLV.—TO PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY.
[Wentworth Place, Hampstead, August 1820.]

My dear Shelley—I am very much gratified that you, in a foreign country, and with a mind almost over-occupied, should write to me in the strain of the letter beside me. If I do not take advantage of your invitation, it will be prevented by a circumstance I have very much at heart to prophesy. There is no doubt that an English winter would put an end to me, and do so in a lingering, hateful manner. Therefore, I must either voyage or journey to Italy, as a soldier marches up to a battery. My nerves at present are the worst part of me, yet they feel soothed that, come what extreme may, I shall not be destined to remain in one spot long enough to take a[Pg 366] hatred of any four particular bedposts. I am glad you take any pleasure in my poor poem, which I would willingly take the trouble to unwrite, if possible, did I care so much as I have done about reputation. I received a copy of the Cenci, as from yourself, from Hunt. There is only one part of it I am judge of—the poetry and dramatic effect, which by many spirits nowadays is considered the Mammon. A modern work, it is said, must have a purpose, which may be the God. An artist must serve Mammon; he must have “self-concentration”—selfishness, perhaps. You, I am sure, will forgive me for sincerely remarking that you might curb your magnanimity, and be more of an artist, and load every rift of your subject with ore. The thought of such discipline must fall like cold chains upon you, who perhaps never sat with your wings furled for six months together. And is not this extraordinary talk for the writer of Endymion, whose mind was like a pack of scattered cards? I am picked up and sorted to a pip. My imagination is a monastery, and I am its monk. I am in expectation of Prometheus every day. Could I have my own wish effected, you would have it still in manuscript, or be but now putting an end to the second act. I remember you advising me not to publish my first blights, on Hampstead Heath. I am returning advice upon your hands. Most of the poems in the volume I send you have been written above two years, and would never have been published but for hope of gain; so you see I am inclined enough to take your advice now. I must express once more my deep sense of your kindness, adding my sincere thanks and respects for Mrs. Shelley.

In the hope of soon seeing you, I remain most sincerely yours
John Keats.





[Pg 367]

CLVI.—TO JOHN TAYLOR.
Wentworth Place [August 14, 1820].

My dear Taylor—My chest is in such a nervous state, that anything extra, such as speaking to an unaccustomed person, or writing a note, half suffocates me. This journey to Italy wakes me at daylight every morning, and haunts me horribly. I shall endeavour to go, though it be with the sensation of marching up against a battery. The first step towards it is to know the expense of a journey and a year’s residence, which if you will ascertain for me, and let me know early, you will greatly serve me. I have more to say, but must desist, for every line I write increases the tightness of my chest, and I have many more to do. I am convinced that this sort of thing does not continue for nothing. If you can come, with any of our friends, do.

Your sincere friend
John Keats.





CLVII.—TO BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON.
Mrs. Brawne’s Next door to Brown’s,
Wentworth Place, Hampstead,
[August] 1820.

My dear Haydon—I am much better this morning than I was when I wrote the note: that is my hopes and spirits are better which are generally at a very low ebb from such a protracted illness. I shall be here for a little time and at home all and every day. A journey to Italy is recommended me, which I have resolved upon and am beginning to prepare for. Hoping to see you shortly

I remain your affectionate friend
John Keats.





[Pg 368]

CLVIII.—TO CHARLES BROWN.
[Wentworth Place, August 1820.]

My dear Brown—You may not have heard from ——, or ——, or in any way, that an attack of spitting of blood, and all its weakening consequences, has prevented me from writing for so long a time. I have matter now for a very long letter, but not news: so I must cut everything short. I shall make some confession, which you will be the only person, for many reasons, I shall trust with. A winter in England would, I have not a doubt, kill me; so I have resolved to go to Italy, either by sea or land. Not that I have any great hopes of that, for, I think, there is a core of disease in me not easy to pull out. I shall be obliged to set off in less than a month. Do not, my dear Brown, teaze yourself about me. You must fill up your time as well as you can, and as happily. You must think of my faults as lightly as you can. When I have health I will bring up the long arrear of letters I owe you. My book has had good success among the literary people, and I believe has a moderate sale. I have seen very few people we know. —— has visited me more than any one. I would go to —— and make some inquiries after you, if I could with any bearable sensation; but a person I am not quite used to causes an oppression on my chest. Last week I received a letter from Shelley, at Pisa, of a very kind nature, asking me to pass the winter with him. Hunt has behaved very kindly to me. You shall hear from me again shortly.

Your affectionate friend
John Keats.





CLIX.—TO FANNY KEATS.
Wentworth Place, Wednesday Morning.
[August 23, 1820.]

My dear Fanny—It will give me great Pleasure to see you here, if you can contrive it; though I confess I should[Pg 369] have written instead of calling upon you before I set out on my journey, from the wish of avoiding unpleasant partings. Meantime I will just notice some parts of your Letter. The seal-breaking business is over blown. I think no more of it. A few days ago I wrote to Mr. Brown, asking him to befriend me with his company to Rome. His answer is not yet come, and I do not know when it will, not being certain how far he may be from the Post Office to which my communication is addressed. Let us hope he will go with me. George certainly ought to have written to you: his troubles, anxieties and fatigues are not quite a sufficient excuse. In the course of time you will be sure to find that this neglect, is not forgetfulness. I am sorry to hear you have been so ill and in such low spirits. Now you are better, keep so. Do not suffer your Mind to dwell on unpleasant reflections—that sort of thing has been the destruction of my health. Nothing is so bad as want of health—it makes one envy scavengers and cinder-sifters. There are enough real distresses and evils in wait for every one to try the most vigorous health. Not that I would say yours are not real—but they are such as to tempt you to employ your imagination on them, rather than endeavour to dismiss them entirely. Do not diet your mind with grief, it destroys the constitution; but let your chief care be of your health, and with that you will meet your share of Pleasure in the world—do not doubt it. If I return well from Italy I will turn over a new leaf for you. I have been improving lately, and have very good hopes of “turning a Neuk” and cheating the consumption. I am not well enough to write to George myself—Mr Haslam will do it for me, to whom I shall write to-day, desiring him to mention as gently as possible your complaint. I am, my dear Fanny,

Your affectionate Brother
John.





[Pg 370]

CLX.—TO CHARLES BROWN.
[Wentworth Place, August 1820.]

My dear Brown—I ought to be off at the end of this week, as the cold winds begin to blow towards evening;—but I will wait till I have your answer to this. I am to be introduced, before I set out, to a Dr. Clark, a physician settled at Rome, who promises to befriend me in every way there. The sale of my book is very slow, though it has been very highly rated. One of the causes, I understand from different quarters, of the unpopularity of this new book, is the offence the ladies take at me. On thinking that matter over, I am certain that I have said nothing in a spirit to displease any woman I would care to please; but still there is a tendency to class women in my books with roses and sweetmeats,—they never see themselves dominant. I will say no more, but, waiting in anxiety for your answer, doff my hat, and make a purse as long as I can.

Your affectionate friend
John Keats.





CLXI.—TO CHARLES BROWN.
Saturday, September 28 [1820], Maria Crowther,
Off Yarmouth, Isle of Wight.

My dear Brown—The time has not yet come for a pleasant letter from me. I have delayed writing to you from time to time, because I felt how impossible it was to enliven you with one heartening hope of my recovery; this morning in bed the matter struck me in a different manner; I thought I would write “while I was in some liking,” or I might become too ill to write at all; and then if the desire to have written should become strong it would be a great affliction to me. I have many more letters to write, and I bless my stars that I have begun, for time seems to press,—this may be my best opportunity. We are in a calm, and I am easy enough this[Pg 371] morning. If my spirits seem too low you may in some degree impute it to our having been at sea a fortnight without making any way.[119] I was very disappointed at not meeting you at Bedhampton, and am very provoked at the thought of you being at Chichester to-day. I should have delighted in setting off for London for the sensation merely,—for what should I do there? I could not leave my lungs or stomach or other worse things behind me. I wish to write on subjects that will not agitate me much—there is one I must mention and have done with it. Even if my body would recover of itself, this would prevent it. The very thing which I want to live most for will be a great occasion of my death. I cannot help it. Who can help it? Were I in health it would make me ill, and how can I bear it in my state? I daresay you will be able to guess on what subject I am harping—you know what was my greatest pain during the first part of my illness at your house. I wish for death every day and night to deliver me from these pains, and then I wish death away, for death would destroy even those pains which are better than nothing. Land and sea, weakness and decline, are great separators, but death is the great divorcer for ever. When the pang of this thought has passed through my mind, I may say the bitterness of death is passed. I often wish for you that you might flatter me with the best. I think without my mentioning it for my sake you would be a friend to Miss Brawne when I am dead. You think she has many faults—but for my sake think she has not one. If there is anything you can do for her by word or deed I know you will do it. I am in a state at present in which woman merely as woman can have no more power over me than stocks and stones, and yet the difference of my sensations with respect to Miss Brawne and my sister is[Pg 372] amazing. The one seems to absorb the other to a degree incredible. I seldom think of my brother and sister in America. The thought of leaving Miss Brawne is beyond everything horrible—the sense of darkness coming over me—I eternally see her figure eternally vanishing. Some of the phrases she was in the habit of using during my last nursing at Wentworth Place ring in my ears. Is there another life? Shall I awake and find all this a dream? There must be, we cannot be created for this sort of suffering. The receiving this letter is to be one of yours. I will say nothing about our friendship, or rather yours to me, more than that, as you deserve to escape, you will never be so unhappy as I am. I should think of—you in my last moments. I shall endeavour to write to Miss Brawne if possible to-day. A sudden stop to my life in the middle of one of these letters would be no bad thing, for it keeps one in a sort of fever awhile. Though fatigued with a letter longer than any I have written for a long while, it would be better to go on for ever than awake to a sense of contrary winds. We expect to put into Portland Roads to-night. The captain, the crew, and the passengers, are all ill-tempered and weary. I shall write to Dilke. I feel as if I was closing my last letter to you.

My dear Brown, your affectionate friend
John Keats.





CLXII.—TO MRS. BRAWNE.
October 24 [1820], Naples Harbour.

My dear Mrs. Brawne—A few words will tell you what sort of a Passage we had, and what situation we are in, and few they must be on account of the Quarantine, our Letters being liable to be opened for the purpose of fumigation at the Health Office. We have to remain in the vessel ten days and are at present shut in a tier of ships. The sea air has been beneficial to me about to as great an extent as squally weather and bad accommodations[Pg 373] and provisions has done harm. So I am about as I was. Give my Love to Fanny and tell her, if I were well there is enough in this Port of Naples to fill a quire of Paper—but it looks like a dream—every man who can row his boat and walk and talk seems a different being from myself. I do not feel in the world. It has been unfortunate for me that one of the Passengers is a young Lady in a Consumption—her imprudence has vexed me very much—the knowledge of her complaints—the flushings in her face, all her bad symptoms have preyed upon me—they would have done so had I been in good health. Severn now is a very good fellow but his nerves are too strong to be hurt by other people’s illnesses—I remember poor Rice wore me in the same way in the Isle of Wight—I shall feel a load off me when the Lady vanishes out of my sight. It is impossible to describe exactly in what state of health I am—at this moment I am suffering from indigestion very much, which makes such stuff of this Letter. I would always wish you to think me a little worse than I really am; not being of a sanguine disposition I am likely to succeed. If I do not recover your regret will be softened—if I do your pleasure will be doubled. I dare not fix my Mind upon Fanny, I have not dared to think of her. The only comfort I have had that way has been in thinking for hours together of having the knife she gave me put in a silver-case—the hair in a Locket—and the Pocket Book in a gold net. Show her this. I dare say no more. Yet you must not believe I am so ill as this Letter may look, for if ever there was a person born without the faculty of hoping I am he. Severn is writing to Haslam, and I have just asked him to request Haslam to send you his account of my health. O what an account I could give you of the Bay of Naples if I could once more feel myself a Citizen of this world—I feel a spirit in my Brain would lay it forth pleasantly—O what a misery it is to have an intellect in splints! My Love again to Fanny—tell Tootts I wish I could pitch her a basket of grapes—and tell Sam the fellows catch[Pg 374] here with a line a little fish much like an anchovy, pull them up fast. Remember me to Mr. and Mrs. Dilke—mention to Brown that I wrote him a letter at Portsmouth which I did not send and am in doubt if he ever will see it.

My dear Mrs. Brawne, yours sincerely and affectionate
John Keats.

Good bye Fanny! God bless you.





CLXIII.—TO CHARLES BROWN.
Naples, November 1 [1820].

My dear Brown—Yesterday we were let out of quarantine, during which my health suffered more from bad air and the stifled cabin than it had done the whole voyage. The fresh air revived me a little, and I hope I am well enough this morning to write to you a short calm letter;—if that can be called one, in which I am afraid to speak of what I would fainest dwell upon. As I have gone thus far into it, I must go on a little;—perhaps it may relieve the load of wretchedness which presses upon me. The persuasion that I shall see her no more will kill me. My dear Brown, I should have had her when I was in health, and I should have remained well. I can bear to die—I cannot bear to leave her. Oh, God! God! God! Every thing I have in my trunks that reminds me of her goes through me like a spear. The silk lining she put in my travelling cap scalds my head. My imagination is horribly vivid about her—I see her—I hear her. There is nothing in the world of sufficient interest to divert me from her a moment. This was the case when I was in England; I cannot recollect, without shuddering, the time that I was a prisoner at Hunt’s, and used to keep my eyes fixed on Hampstead all day. Then there was a good hope of seeing her again—Now!—O that I could be buried near where she lives! I am afraid to write to her—to receive a letter from her—to see her handwriting[Pg 375] would break my heart—even to hear of her anyhow, to see her name written, would be more than I can bear. My dear Brown, what am I to do? Where can I look for consolation or ease? If I had any chance of recovery, this passion would kill me. Indeed, through the whole of my illness, both at your house and at Kentish Town, this fever has never ceased wearing me out. When you write to me, which you will do immediately, write to Rome (poste restante)—if she is well and happy, put a mark thus +; if——

Remember me to all. I will endeavour to bear my miseries patiently. A person in my state of health should not have such miseries to bear. Write a short note to my sister, saying you have heard from me. Severn is very well. If I were in better health I would urge your coming to Rome. I fear there is no one can give me any comfort. Is there any news of George? O that something fortunate had ever happened to me or my brothers!—then I might hope,—but despair is forced upon me as a habit. My dear Brown, for my sake be her advocate for ever. I cannot say a word about Naples; I do not feel at all concerned in the thousand novelties around me. I am afraid to write to her—I should like her to know that I do not forget her. Oh, Brown I have coals of fire in my breast—It surprises me that the human heart is capable of containing and bearing so much misery. Was I born for this end? God bless her, and her mother, and my sister, and George, and his wife, and you, and all!

Your ever affectionate friend
John Keats.


[Thursday, November 2.]

I was a day too early for the Courier. He sets out now. I have been more calm to-day, though in a half dread of not continuing so. I said nothing of my health; I know nothing of it; you will hear Severn’s account from Haslam. I must leave off. You bring my thoughts too near to Fanny. God bless you!





[Pg 376]

CLXIV.—TO CHARLES BROWN.
Rome, November 30, 1820.

My dear Brown—’Tis the most difficult thing in the world to me to write a letter. My stomach continues so bad, that I feel it worse on opening any book,—yet I am much better than I was in quarantine. Then I am afraid to encounter the pro-ing and con-ing of anything interesting to me in England. I have an habitual feeling of my real life having passed, and that I am leading a posthumous existence. God knows how it would have been—but it appears to me—however, I will not speak of that subject. I must have been at Bedhampton nearly at the time you were writing to me from Chichester—how unfortunate—and to pass on the river too! There was my star predominant! I cannot answer anything in your letter, which followed me from Naples to Rome, because I am afraid to look it over again. I am so weak (in mind) that I cannot bear the sight of any handwriting of a friend I love so much as I do you. Yet I ride the little horse, and at my worst even in quarantine, summoned up more puns, in a sort of desperation, in one week than in any year of my life. There is one thought enough to kill me; I have been well, healthy, alert, etc., walking with her, and now—the knowledge of contrast, feeling for light and shade, all that information (primitive sense) necessary for a poem, are great enemies to the recovery of the stomach. There, you rogue, I put you to the torture; but you must bring your philosophy to bear, as I do mine, really, or how should I be able to live? Dr. Clark is very attentive to me; he says, there is very little the matter with my lungs, but my stomach, he says, is very bad. I am well disappointed in hearing good news from George, for it runs in my head we shall all die young. I have not written to Reynolds yet, which he must think very neglectful; being anxious to send him a good account of my health, I have delayed it[Pg 377] from week to week. If I recover, I will do all in my power to correct the mistakes made during sickness; and if I should not, all my faults will be forgiven. Severn is very well, though he leads so dull a life with me. Remember me to all friends, and tell Haslam I should not have left London without taking leave of him, but from being so low in body and mind. Write to George as soon as you receive this, and tell him how I am, as far as you can guess; and also a note to my sister—who walks about my imagination like a ghost—she is so like Tom. I can scarcely bid you good-bye, even in a letter. I always made an awkward bow.

God bless you!
John Keats.[120]

THE END

Footnotes:

[A] A complete friend. This line sounded very oddly to me at first.

[B] Especially as I have a black eye.

[1] Macmillan’s Magazine, August 1888.

[2] For the letters already printed by Lord Houghton, Mr. Forman as a rule simply copied the text of that editor. The letters to Fanny Brawne and Fanny Keats, on the other hand, he printed with great accuracy from the autographs, and had autographs also before him in revising those to Dilke, Haydon, and several besides. The correspondence with Fanny Keats he kindly gave me leave to use for the present volume, receiving from me in return the right to use my MS. materials for a revised issue of his own work. In that issue, which appeared at the end of 1889, the new matter is, however, printed separately, in the form of scraps and addenda detached from their context; and the present edition (the appearance of which has been delayed for two years by accidental circumstances) is the only one in which the true text of the American and miscellaneous letters is given consecutively and in proper order.

[3] The letters in which I have relied wholly or in part on Mr. Speed’s text are Nos. xxv. lxxx. (only for a few passages missing in the autograph) cxvi. and cxxxi.

[4] Where the dates in my text are printed without brackets, they are those given by Keats himself; the dates within brackets have been supplied either from the postmarks (as was done by Woodhouse in all his transcripts) or by inference from the text.

[5] The autographs of these letters, all except three, are now in the British Museum.

[6] The early letters of Keats are full of these Shakspearean tags and allusions: some of the less familiar I have thought it worth while to mark in the footnotes.

[7] The references are of course to Wordsworth, Leigh Hunt, and Haydon. In the sonnet as printed in the Poems of 1817, and all later editions, the last line but one breaks off at “workings,” the words “in the human mart” having been omitted by Haydon’s advice.

[8] Presumably as shown in some drawing or miniature.

[9] Not the long poem published under that title in 1818, but the earlier attempt beginning, “I stood tiptoe upon a little hill,” which was printed as a fragment in the Poems of 1817.

[10] This letter, which is marked by Woodhouse in his copy “no date, sent by hand,” I take to be an answer to the commendatory sonnet addressed by Reynolds to Keats on February 27, 1817: see Keats (Men of Letters Series), Appendix, p. 223.

[11] For Stephano’s “Here’s my comfort,” twice in Tempest, II. ii.

[12]

“I’ll not show him
Where the quick freshes are.”
Caliban in Tempest, III. ii.

[13] This sonnet was first published in the Champion (edited by John Scott) for August 17, 1817.

[14] Charles Cowden Clarke.

[15] For Sunday, May 4, 1817.

[16] The first part, published in the same number of the Examiner, of a ferocious review by Hazlitt of Southey’s Letter to William Smith, Esq., M.P.

[17] The poem so entitled on which Hunt was now at work, and which was published in the volume called Foliage (1818).

[18] Alluding to the well-known story of Shelley dismaying an old lady in a stage-coach by suddenly, à propos of nothing, crying out to Leigh Hunt in the words of Richard II., “For God’s sake, let us sit upon the ground,” etc.

[19] Opening speech of the King in Love’s Labour’s Lost.

[20] I.e., their likenesses, as introduced by Haydon into his picture of Christ’s Entry into Jerusalem.

[21] General Bertrand, who followed Napoleon to St. Helena.

[22] On a visit to Benjamin Bailey at Magdalen Hall.

[23] Littlehampton.

[24] Reynolds’s family lived in Little Britain.

[25] William Dilke, a younger brother of Charles Dilke, who had served in the Commissariat department in the Peninsula, America, and Paris. He died in 1885 at the age of 90.

[26] The Round Table: republished from the Examiner of the two preceding years.

[27] First Lord in All’s Well that Ends Well, IV. iii.

[28] Bentley, the Hampstead postman, was Keats’s landlord at the house in Well Walk where he and his brothers had taken up their quarters the previous June.

[29] G. R. Gleig, son of the Bishop of Stirling: born 1796, died 1888: served in the Peninsula War and afterwards took orders: Chaplain-General to the Forces from 1846 to 1875: author of the Subaltern and many military tales and histories.

[30] Reynolds and Rice.

[31] Sic: for “unpaid”?

[32]

“She disappear’d, and left me dark: I waked
To find her, or for ever to deplore
Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:
When, out of hope, behold her not far off,
Such as I saw her in my dream, adorn’d
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow
To make her amiable.”
Paradise Lost, Book VIII.

[33] Charles Wells, a schoolmate of Tom Keats; afterwards author of Stories after Nature and Joseph and his Brethren. For Keats’s subsequent cause of quarrel with him see below, Letter XCII.

[34] An admirable phrase!—if only penetralium were Latin.

[35] Laon and Cythna, presently changed to The Revolt of Islam.

[36] The family of Charles Wells lived at this address.

[37] Both in fact appeared in the number for Sunday, January 4: see postscript below.

[38] The Hampstead doctor who attended the Keats brothers.

[39] The text of this letter is described by its American editor (who seems to have mistaken the order of one or two passages) as written in an evident hurry and almost illegible.

[40] Mr. Kingston was a Commissioner of Stamps, an acquaintance and tiresome hanger-on of Wordsworth.

[41] For a more glowing account of this supper party of December 28, 1817, compare Haydon, Autobiography, i. p. 384. The Mr. Ritchie referred to started on a Government mission to Fezzan in September 1818, and died at Morzouk the following November. An account of the expedition was published by his travelling companion, Captain G. F. Lyon, R.N.

[42] The manager: of whom Macready in his Reminiscences has so much that is pleasant to say.

[43] Tea-merchant, of Pancras Lane and Walthamstow: guardian to the Keats brothers and their sister.

[44] Of course a mere delusion; but Hunt and those of his circle retained for years afterwards an impression that Scott had in some way inspired or encouraged the Cockney School articles.

[45] Alluding to two sonnets of Reynolds On Robin Hood, copies of which Keats had just received from him by post. They were printed in the Yellow Dwarf (edited by John Hunt) for February 21, 1818, and again in the collection of poems published by Reynolds in 1821 under the title A Garden of Florence.

[46] Both the Robin Hood and the Mermaid lines as afterwards printed vary in several places from these first drafts.

[47] Henry Crabb Robinson, author of the Diaries.

[48] The Olliers (Shelley’s publishers) had brought out Keats’s Poems the previous spring, and the ill success of the volume had led to a sharp quarrel between them and the Keats brothers.

[49] Georgiana Wylie, to whom George Keats was engaged.

[50] This letter has been hitherto erroneously printed under date September 1818.

[51] Reading doubtful.

[52] The five lines ending here Keats afterwards re-cast, doubtless in order to get rid of the cockney rhyme “ports” and “thoughts.”

[53] “And, sweetheart, lie thou there”:—Pistol (to his sword) in Henry IV., Part 2, II. iv.

[54] Replying to an ecstatic note of Haydon’s about a seal with a true lover’s knot and the initials W. S., lately found in a field at Stratford-on-Avon.

[55] Dentatus was the subject of Haydon’s new picture.

[56] The famous picture now belonging to Lady Wantage, and exhibited at Burlington House in 1888. Whether Keats ever saw the original is doubtful (it was not shown at the British Institution in his time), but he must have been familiar with the subject as engraved by Vivarès and Woollett, and its suggestive power worked in his mind until it yielded at last the distilled poetic essence of the “magic casement” passage in the Ode to a Nightingale. It is interesting to note the theme of the Grecian Urn ode coming in also amidst the “unconnected subject and careless verse” of this rhymed epistle.

[57] Sic: probably, as suggested by Mr. Forman, for “I hope what you achieve is not lost upon me.”

[58] The English rebels against tradition in poetry and art at this time took much the same view of the French dramatists of the grand siècle as was taken by the romantiques of their own nation a few years later; and Haydon had written to Keats in his last letter, “When I die I’ll have Shakspeare placed on my heart, with Homer in my right hand and Ariosto in the other, Dante at my head, Tasso at my feet, and Corneille under my ——”

[59] “He hath fought with a Warrener”:—Simple in Merry Wives, I. iv.

[60] The first draught of the proposed preface to Endymion.

[61] Changed in the printed version to—“His image in the dusk she seemed to see.”

[62] The quotation is from Slender in Merry Wives of Windsor, I. i.

[63] Meaning the atmosphere of the little Bentleys in Well Walk.

[64] “I will make an end of my dinner; there’s pippins and cheese to come”:—Sir Hugh Evans in Merry Wives of Windsor, I. ii.

[65] The crossing of the letter, begun at the words “Have you not,” here dips into the original writing.

[66] The Oxford Herald for June 6, 1818.

[67] Referring probably to the unfortunate second marriage made by their mother.

[68] A leaf with the name and “from the Author,” notes Woodhouse.

[69] Compare the Ode to Psyche:—

“Far, far around shall those dark-crested trees
Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep.”

[70] Wordsworth’s lines “To Joanna” seem to have been special favourites with Keats.

[71] Keats here repeats for his brother the Meg Merrilies piece contained in the preceding letter to Fanny.

[72] Reading doubtful.

[73] Here follows a sketch.

[74] The Swan and Two Necks, Lad Lane, London, seems to have been the coach office for Liverpool and the North-West; compare Lamb’s Letters (ed. Ainger), vol. i. p. 241.

[75] By Long Island Keats means, not of course the great chain of the Outer Hebrides so styled, but the little island of Luing, east of Scarba Sound. His account of the place from which he is writing, and its distance from Oban as specified in the paragraph added there next day, seem to identify it certainly as Kilmelfort.

[76] Cary’s translation.

[77] No place so named appears on any map: but at the foot of the Cruach-Doire-nan-Cuílean, off the road, is a house named Derrynaculan, and a few miles farther on, at the head of Loch Seridain, an ancient fortified site or Dun, with an inn on the road near by.

[78] For Loch na Keal.

[79] The six lines from “place” to “dance” were judiciously omitted by Keats in copying these verses later.

[80] Miss Charlotte Cox, an East-Indian cousin of the Reynoldses—the “Charmian” described more fully in Letter LXXIII.

[81] Referring to these words in John Scott’s letter in his defence, Morning Chronicle, October 3, 1818:—“That there are also many, very many passages indicating both haste and carelessness I will not deny; nay, I will go further, and assert that a real friend of the author would have dissuaded him from immediate publication.”

[82] Miss Charlotte Cox; see above, Letter LXX.

[83] This, notes Woodhouse, is in reply to a letter of protest he had written Keats concerning “what had fallen from him, about six weeks back, when we dined together at Mr. Hessey’s, respecting his continuing to write; which he seemed very doubtful of.”

[84] On the death of his brother Tom (which took place December 1, a few hours after the last letter was written) Brown urged Keats to leave the lodgings where the brothers had lived together, and come and live with him at Wentworth Place—a block of two semi-detached houses in a large garden at the bottom of John Street, of which Dilke occupied the larger and Brown the smaller: see Keats (Men of Letters Series), p. 128. Keats complied; and henceforth his letters dated Hampstead must be understood as written not from Well Walk, but from Wentworth Place.

[85] A paper of the largest folio size, used by Keats in this letter only, and containing some eight hundred words a page of his writing.

[86] This is Keats’s first mention of Fanny Brawne. His sense on first acquaintance of her power to charm and tease him must be understood, in spite of his reticence on the subject, as having grown quickly into the absorbing passion which tormented the remainder of his days.

[87] Of Bedhampton Castle: a connection of the Dilkes and special friend of Brown.

[88] I.e. on George Keats’s mother-in-law, Mrs. Wylie.

[89] The tassels were a gift from his sister-in-law.

[90] The sheet which Keats accidentally left out in making up his packet in the spring, and which he forwarded with this supplement from Winchester the following September, seems to have begun with the words, “On Monday we had to dinner,” etc. (p. 231), and to have ended with the words, “but as I am” (p. 235, line 1): at least this portion of the letter is missing in the autograph now before me. I supply it from Jeffrey’s transcript.

[91] To about this date must belong the posthumously printed Ode on Indolence, which describes the same mood with nearly the same imagery. Possibly the “black eye” mentioned by Keats in his footnote, together with the reflections on street-fighting later on, may help us to fix the date of his famous fight with the butcher boy.

[92] Compare the repetition of the same thought and phrase in the ode To a Nightingale written two months later.

[93] Slightly misquoted from Macbeth in the banquet scene.

[94] By mistake for the 19th of March.

[95] For “put together”?

[96] Brown’s younger brothers: see below, p. 245.

[97]

“Sometime am I
All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness.”
Caliban in Tempest, II. ii.

[98] This old word for a snack between meals is used by Marlowe and Ben Jonson, and I believe still survives at some of the public schools.

[99] This notice of Reynolds’s parody was printed, with some revision, in the Examiner for April 26, 1819.

[100] There is no other autograph copy of this famous poem except the draft here given. It contains several erasures and corrections. In verse 3 Keats had written first, for “a lily” and “a fading rose,” “death’s lily” and “death’s fading rose”: in verse 4, for “Meads,” “Wilds”: in verse 7, for “manna dew,” “honey dew”: in verse 8, for “and sigh’d full sore,” “and there she sigh’d”; in verse 11, for “gaped wide,” “wide agape”: and in verse 12, for “sojourn,” “wither.”

[101] Sic: obviously for “run” or “go.”

[102] In all probability the Ode to a Nightingale, published in the July number of the Annals of the Fine Arts, of which James Elmes was editor.

[103] This and the next interpolation are Brown’s.

[104] So copied by Woodhouse: query “battle-axe”?

[105] Keats’s quotation from his first draft of Lamia continued, says Woodhouse, for thirty lines more: but as the text varied much from that subsequently printed, and as Woodhouse’s notes of these variations are lost, I can only give thus much, from an autograph first draft of the passage in the possession of Lord Houghton.

[106] Keats here copies, with slight changes and abridgments, his letter to Tom of July 23, 1818 (see above, p. 147), ending with the lines written after visiting Staffa: as to which he adds, “I find I must keep memorandums of the verses I send you, for I do not remember whether I have sent the following lines upon Staffa. I hope not; ’twould be a horrid bore to you, especially after reading this dull specimen of description. For myself I hate descriptions. I would not send it if it were not mine.”

[107] The beautiful Ode to Autumn, the draft of which Keats had copied in a letter (unluckily not preserved) written earlier in the same day to Woodhouse.

[108] Sir George Beaumonts and Lord Mulgraves: compare Haydon’s Life and Correspondence.

[109] In the interval between the last letter and this, Keats had tried the experiment of living alone in Westminster lodgings, and failed. After a visit to his beloved at Hampstead, he could keep none of his wise resolutions, but wrote to her, “I can think of nothing else ... I cannot exist without you ... you have absorb’d me ... I shall be able to do nothing—I should like to cast the die for Love or Death—I have no patience with anything else” ... and at the end of a week he had gone back to live next door to her with Brown at Wentworth Place. Here he quickly fell into that state of feverish despondency and recklessness to which his friends, especially Brown, have borne witness, and the signs of which are perceptible in his letters of the time, and still more in his verse, viz. the remodelled Hyperion and the Cap and Bells: see Keats (Men of Letters Series), pp. 180-190.

[110] Referring to the fairy poem of The Cap and Bells, the writing of which, says Brown, was Keats’s morning occupation during these weeks.

[111] Spenser’s Cave of Despair was the subject of the picture (already referred to in Letter CXXIV.) with which Severn won the Royal Academy premium, awarded December 10 of this year.

[112] George Keats had come over for a hurried visit to England on business.

[113] Hemorrhage from the lungs; in which Keats recognised his death-warrant, and after which the remainder of his life was but that of a doomed invalid. The particulars of the attack, as related by Charles Brown, are given by Lord Houghton, and in Keats (Men of Letters Series), p. 193.

[114] Brown having let his house (Wentworth Place) when he started for a fresh Scotch tour on May 7, Keats moved to lodgings at the above address in order to be near Leigh Hunt, who was then living in Mortimer Terrace, Kentish Town.

[115] The Cap and Bells was to have appeared under this pseudonym. By “begin” Keats means begin again (compare above, CXXXVIII.): he did not, however, do so, and the eighty-eight stanzas of the poem which are left all belong to the previous year (end of October—beginning of December 1819).

[116] The volume containing Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, Hyperion, and the Odes.

[117] After the attack last mentioned, Keats went to be taken care of in Hunt’s house, and stayed there till August 12.

[118] Chapman’s Homer.

[119] The Maria Crowther had in fact sailed from London September 18: contrary winds holding her in the Channel, Keats had landed at Portsmouth for a night’s visit to the Snooks of Bedhampton.

[120] On the 10th of December following came a renewal of fever and hemorrhage, extinguishing the last hope of recovery: and after eleven more weeks of suffering, only alleviated by the devoted care of Severn, the poet died in his friend’s arms on the 23d of February 1821.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689

LAMIA

By John Keats

Part 1

Part 2





Part 1
     Upon a time, before the faery broods
     Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods,
     Before King Oberon's bright diadem,
     Sceptre, and mantle, clasp'd with dewy gem,
     Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns
     From rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip'd lawns,
     The ever-smitten Hermes empty left
     His golden throne, bent warm on amorous theft:
     From high Olympus had he stolen light,
     On this side of Jove's clouds, to escape the sight
     Of his great summoner, and made retreat
     Into a forest on the shores of Crete.
     For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt
     A nymph, to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt;
     At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured
     Pearls, while on land they wither'd and adored.
     Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont,
     And in those meads where sometime she might haunt,
     Were strewn rich gifts, unknown to any Muse,
     Though Fancy's casket were unlock'd to choose.
     Ah, what a world of love was at her feet!
     So Hermes thought, and a celestial heat
     Burnt from his winged heels to either ear,
     That from a whiteness, as the lily clear,
     Blush'd into roses 'mid his golden hair,
     Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare.
     From vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew,
     Breathing upon the flowers his passion new,
     And wound with many a river to its head,
     To find where this sweet nymph prepar'd her secret bed:
     In vain; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found,
     And so he rested, on the lonely ground,
     Pensive, and full of painful jealousies
     Of the Wood-Gods, and even the very trees.
     There as he stood, he heard a mournful voice,
     Such as once heard, in gentle heart, destroys
     All pain but pity: thus the lone voice spake:
     "When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake!
     When move in a sweet body fit for life,
     And love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife
     Of hearts and lips! Ah, miserable me!"
     The God, dove-footed, glided silently
     Round bush and tree, soft-brushing, in his speed,
     The taller grasses and full-flowering weed,
     Until he found a palpitating snake,
     Bright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake.

        She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue,
     Vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue;
     Striped like a zebra, freckled like a pard,
     Eyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr'd;
     And full of silver moons, that, as she breathed,
     Dissolv'd, or brighter shone, or interwreathed
     Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries—
     So rainbow-sided, touch'd with miseries,
     She seem'd, at once, some penanced lady elf,
     Some demon's mistress, or the demon's self.
     Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire
     Sprinkled with stars, like Ariadne's tiar:
     Her head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet!
     She had a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete:
     And for her eyes: what could such eyes do there
     But weep, and weep, that they were born so fair?
     As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air.
     Her throat was serpent, but the words she spake
     Came, as through bubbling honey, for Love's sake,
     And thus; while Hermes on his pinions lay,
     Like a stoop'd falcon ere he takes his prey.

        "Fair Hermes, crown'd with feathers, fluttering light,
     I had a splendid dream of thee last night:
     I saw thee sitting, on a throne of gold,
     Among the Gods, upon Olympus old,
     The only sad one; for thou didst not hear
     The soft, lute-finger'd Muses chaunting clear,
     Nor even Apollo when he sang alone,
     Deaf to his throbbing throat's long, long melodious moan.
     I dreamt I saw thee, robed in purple flakes,
     Break amorous through the clouds, as morning breaks,
     And, swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart,
     Strike for the Cretan isle; and here thou art!
     Too gentle Hermes, hast thou found the maid?"
     Whereat the star of Lethe not delay'd
     His rosy eloquence, and thus inquired:
     "Thou smooth-lipp'd serpent, surely high inspired!
     Thou beauteous wreath, with melancholy eyes,
     Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise,
     Telling me only where my nymph is fled,—
     Where she doth breathe!" "Bright planet, thou hast said,"
     Return'd the snake, "but seal with oaths, fair God!"
     "I swear," said Hermes, "by my serpent rod,
     And by thine eyes, and by thy starry crown!"
     Light flew his earnest words, among the blossoms blown.
     Then thus again the brilliance feminine:
     "Too frail of heart! for this lost nymph of thine,
     Free as the air, invisibly, she strays
     About these thornless wilds; her pleasant days
     She tastes unseen; unseen her nimble feet
     Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet;
     From weary tendrils, and bow'd branches green,
     She plucks the fruit unseen, she bathes unseen:
     And by my power is her beauty veil'd
     To keep it unaffronted, unassail'd
     By the love-glances of unlovely eyes,
     Of Satyrs, Fauns, and blear'd Silenus' sighs.
     Pale grew her immortality, for woe
     Of all these lovers, and she grieved so
     I took compassion on her, bade her steep
     Her hair in weird syrops, that would keep
     Her loveliness invisible, yet free
     To wander as she loves, in liberty.
     Thou shalt behold her, Hermes, thou alone,
     If thou wilt, as thou swearest, grant my boon!"
     Then, once again, the charmed God began
     An oath, and through the serpent's ears it ran
     Warm, tremulous, devout, psalterian.
     Ravish'd, she lifted her Circean head,
     Blush'd a live damask, and swift-lisping said,
     "I was a woman, let me have once more
     A woman's shape, and charming as before.
     I love a youth of Corinth—O the bliss!
     Give me my woman's form, and place me where he is.
     Stoop, Hermes, let me breathe upon thy brow,
     And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now."
     The God on half-shut feathers sank serene,
     She breath'd upon his eyes, and swift was seen
     Of both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green.
     It was no dream; or say a dream it was,
     Real are the dreams of Gods, and smoothly pass
     Their pleasures in a long immortal dream.
     One warm, flush'd moment, hovering, it might seem
     Dash'd by the wood-nymph's beauty, so he burn'd;
     Then, lighting on the printless verdure, turn'd
     To the swoon'd serpent, and with languid arm,
     Delicate, put to proof the lythe Caducean charm.
     So done, upon the nymph his eyes he bent,
     Full of adoring tears and blandishment,
     And towards her stept: she, like a moon in wane,
     Faded before him, cower'd, nor could restrain
     Her fearful sobs, self-folding like a flower
     That faints into itself at evening hour:
     But the God fostering her chilled hand,
     She felt the warmth, her eyelids open'd bland,
     And, like new flowers at morning song of bees,
     Bloom'd, and gave up her honey to the lees.
     Into the green-recessed woods they flew;
     Nor grew they pale, as mortal lovers do.

        Left to herself, the serpent now began
     To change; her elfin blood in madness ran,
     Her mouth foam'd, and the grass, therewith besprent,
     Wither'd at dew so sweet and virulent;
     Her eyes in torture fix'd, and anguish drear,
     Hot, glaz'd, and wide, with lid-lashes all sear,
     Flash'd phosphor and sharp sparks, without one cooling tear.
     The colours all inflam'd throughout her train,
     She writh'd about, convuls'd with scarlet pain:
     A deep volcanian yellow took the place
     Of all her milder-mooned body's grace;
     And, as the lava ravishes the mead,
     Spoilt all her silver mail, and golden brede;
     Made gloom of all her frecklings, streaks and bars,
     Eclips'd her crescents, and lick'd up her stars:
     So that, in moments few, she was undrest
     Of all her sapphires, greens, and amethyst,
     And rubious-argent: of all these bereft,
     Nothing but pain and ugliness were left.
     Still shone her crown; that vanish'd, also she
     Melted and disappear'd as suddenly;
     And in the air, her new voice luting soft,
     Cried, "Lycius! gentle Lycius!"—Borne aloft
     With the bright mists about the mountains hoar
     These words dissolv'd: Crete's forests heard no more.

        Whither fled Lamia, now a lady bright,
     A full-born beauty new and exquisite?
     She fled into that valley they pass o'er
     Who go to Corinth from Cenchreas' shore;
     And rested at the foot of those wild hills,
     The rugged founts of the Peraean rills,
     And of that other ridge whose barren back
     Stretches, with all its mist and cloudy rack,
     South-westward to Cleone. There she stood
     About a young bird's flutter from a wood,
     Fair, on a sloping green of mossy tread,
     By a clear pool, wherein she passioned
     To see herself escap'd from so sore ills,
     While her robes flaunted with the daffodils.

        Ah, happy Lycius!—for she was a maid
     More beautiful than ever twisted braid,
     Or sigh'd, or blush'd, or on spring-flowered lea
     Spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy:
     A virgin purest lipp'd, yet in the lore
     Of love deep learned to the red heart's core:
     Not one hour old, yet of sciential brain
     To unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain;
     Define their pettish limits, and estrange
     Their points of contact, and swift counterchange;
     Intrigue with the specious chaos, and dispart
     Its most ambiguous atoms with sure art;
     As though in Cupid's college she had spent
     Sweet days a lovely graduate, still unshent,
     And kept his rosy terms in idle languishment.

        Why this fair creature chose so fairily
     By the wayside to linger, we shall see;
     But first 'tis fit to tell how she could muse
     And dream, when in the serpent prison-house,
     Of all she list, strange or magnificent:
     How, ever, where she will'd, her spirit went;
     Whether to faint Elysium, or where
     Down through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair
     Wind into Thetis' bower by many a pearly stair;
     Or where God Bacchus drains his cups divine,
     Stretch'd out, at ease, beneath a glutinous pine;
     Or where in Pluto's gardens palatine
     Mulciber's columns gleam in far piazzian line.
     And sometimes into cities she would send
     Her dream, with feast and rioting to blend;
     And once, while among mortals dreaming thus,
     She saw the young Corinthian Lycius
     Charioting foremost in the envious race,
     Like a young Jove with calm uneager face,
     And fell into a swooning love of him.
     Now on the moth-time of that evening dim
     He would return that way, as well she knew,
     To Corinth from the shore; for freshly blew
     The eastern soft wind, and his galley now
     Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow
     In port Cenchreas, from Egina isle
     Fresh anchor'd; whither he had been awhile
     To sacrifice to Jove, whose temple there
     Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare.
     Jove heard his vows, and better'd his desire;
     For by some freakful chance he made retire
     From his companions, and set forth to walk,
     Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk:
     Over the solitary hills he fared,
     Thoughtless at first, but ere eve's star appeared
     His phantasy was lost, where reason fades,
     In the calm'd twilight of Platonic shades.
     Lamia beheld him coming, near, more near—
     Close to her passing, in indifference drear,
     His silent sandals swept the mossy green;
     So neighbour'd to him, and yet so unseen
     She stood: he pass'd, shut up in mysteries,
     His mind wrapp'd like his mantle, while her eyes
     Follow'd his steps, and her neck regal white
     Turn'd—syllabling thus, "Ah, Lycius bright,
     And will you leave me on the hills alone?
     Lycius, look back! and be some pity shown."
     He did; not with cold wonder fearingly,
     But Orpheus-like at an Eurydice;
     For so delicious were the words she sung,
     It seem'd he had lov'd them a whole summer long:
     And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up,
     Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup,
     And still the cup was full,—while he afraid
     Lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid
     Due adoration, thus began to adore;
     Her soft look growing coy, she saw his chain so sure:
     "Leave thee alone! Look back! Ah, Goddess, see
     Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee!
     For pity do not this sad heart belie—
     Even as thou vanishest so I shall die.
     Stay! though a Naiad of the rivers, stay!
     To thy far wishes will thy streams obey:
     Stay! though the greenest woods be thy domain,
     Alone they can drink up the morning rain:
     Though a descended Pleiad, will not one
     Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune
     Thy spheres, and as thy silver proxy shine?
     So sweetly to these ravish'd ears of mine
     Came thy sweet greeting, that if thou shouldst fade
     Thy memory will waste me to a shade—
     For pity do not melt!"—"If I should stay,"
     Said Lamia, "here, upon this floor of clay,
     And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough,
     What canst thou say or do of charm enough
     To dull the nice remembrance of my home?
     Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam
     Over these hills and vales, where no joy is,—
     Empty of immortality and bliss!
     Thou art a scholar, Lycius, and must know
     That finer spirits cannot breathe below
     In human climes, and live: Alas! poor youth,
     What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe
     My essence? What serener palaces,
     Where I may all my many senses please,
     And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease?
     It cannot be—Adieu!" So said, she rose
     Tiptoe with white arms spread. He, sick to lose
     The amorous promise of her lone complain,
     Swoon'd, murmuring of love, and pale with pain.
     The cruel lady, without any show
     Of sorrow for her tender favourite's woe,
     But rather, if her eyes could brighter be,
     With brighter eyes and slow amenity,
     Put her new lips to his, and gave afresh
     The life she had so tangled in her mesh:
     And as he from one trance was wakening
     Into another, she began to sing,
     Happy in beauty, life, and love, and every thing,
     A song of love, too sweet for earthly lyres,
     While, like held breath, the stars drew in their panting fires
     And then she whisper'd in such trembling tone,
     As those who, safe together met alone
     For the first time through many anguish'd days,
     Use other speech than looks; bidding him raise
     His drooping head, and clear his soul of doubt,
     For that she was a woman, and without
     Any more subtle fluid in her veins
     Than throbbing blood, and that the self-same pains
     Inhabited her frail-strung heart as his.
     And next she wonder'd how his eyes could miss
     Her face so long in Corinth, where, she said,
     She dwelt but half retir'd, and there had led
     Days happy as the gold coin could invent
     Without the aid of love; yet in content
     Till she saw him, as once she pass'd him by,
     Where 'gainst a column he leant thoughtfully
     At Venus' temple porch, 'mid baskets heap'd
     Of amorous herbs and flowers, newly reap'd
     Late on that eve, as 'twas the night before
     The Adonian feast; whereof she saw no more,
     But wept alone those days, for why should she adore?
     Lycius from death awoke into amaze,
     To see her still, and singing so sweet lays;
     Then from amaze into delight he fell
     To hear her whisper woman's lore so well;
     And every word she spake entic'd him on
     To unperplex'd delight and pleasure known.
     Let the mad poets say whate'er they please
     Of the sweets of Fairies, Peris, Goddesses,
     There is not such a treat among them all,
     Haunters of cavern, lake, and waterfall,
     As a real woman, lineal indeed
     From Pyrrha's pebbles or old Adam's seed.
     Thus gentle Lamia judg'd, and judg'd aright,
     That Lycius could not love in half a fright,
     So threw the goddess off, and won his heart
     More pleasantly by playing woman's part,
     With no more awe than what her beauty gave,
     That, while it smote, still guaranteed to save.
     Lycius to all made eloquent reply,
     Marrying to every word a twinborn sigh;
     And last, pointing to Corinth, ask'd her sweet,
     If 'twas too far that night for her soft feet.
     The way was short, for Lamia's eagerness
     Made, by a spell, the triple league decrease
     To a few paces; not at all surmised
     By blinded Lycius, so in her comprized.
     They pass'd the city gates, he knew not how
     So noiseless, and he never thought to know.

        As men talk in a dream, so Corinth all,
     Throughout her palaces imperial,
     And all her populous streets and temples lewd,
     Mutter'd, like tempest in the distance brew'd,
     To the wide-spreaded night above her towers.
     Men, women, rich and poor, in the cool hours,
     Shuffled their sandals o'er the pavement white,
     Companion'd or alone; while many a light
     Flared, here and there, from wealthy festivals,
     And threw their moving shadows on the walls,
     Or found them cluster'd in the corniced shade
     Of some arch'd temple door, or dusky colonnade.

        Muffling his face, of greeting friends in fear,
     Her fingers he press'd hard, as one came near
     With curl'd gray beard, sharp eyes, and smooth bald crown,
     Slow-stepp'd, and robed in philosophic gown:
     Lycius shrank closer, as they met and past,
     Into his mantle, adding wings to haste,
     While hurried Lamia trembled: "Ah," said he,
     "Why do you shudder, love, so ruefully?
     Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew?"—
     "I'm wearied," said fair Lamia: "tell me who
     Is that old man? I cannot bring to mind
     His features—Lycius! wherefore did you blind
     Yourself from his quick eyes?" Lycius replied,
     'Tis Apollonius sage, my trusty guide
     And good instructor; but to-night he seems
     The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams.

        While yet he spake they had arrived before
     A pillar'd porch, with lofty portal door,
     Where hung a silver lamp, whose phosphor glow
     Reflected in the slabbed steps below,
     Mild as a star in water; for so new,
     And so unsullied was the marble hue,
     So through the crystal polish, liquid fine,
     Ran the dark veins, that none but feet divine
     Could e'er have touch'd there. Sounds Aeolian
     Breath'd from the hinges, as the ample span
     Of the wide doors disclos'd a place unknown
     Some time to any, but those two alone,
     And a few Persian mutes, who that same year
     Were seen about the markets: none knew where
     They could inhabit; the most curious
     Were foil'd, who watch'd to trace them to their house:
     And but the flitter-winged verse must tell,
     For truth's sake, what woe afterwards befel,
     'Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus,
     Shut from the busy world of more incredulous.





Part 2
     Love in a hut, with water and a crust,
     Is—Love, forgive us!—cinders, ashes, dust;
     Love in a palace is perhaps at last
     More grievous torment than a hermit's fast—
     That is a doubtful tale from faery land,
     Hard for the non-elect to understand.
     Had Lycius liv'd to hand his story down,
     He might have given the moral a fresh frown,
     Or clench'd it quite: but too short was their bliss
     To breed distrust and hate, that make the soft voice hiss.
     Besides, there, nightly, with terrific glare,
     Love, jealous grown of so complete a pair,
     Hover'd and buzz'd his wings, with fearful roar,
     Above the lintel of their chamber door,
     And down the passage cast a glow upon the floor.

        For all this came a ruin: side by side
     They were enthroned, in the even tide,
     Upon a couch, near to a curtaining
     Whose airy texture, from a golden string,
     Floated into the room, and let appear
     Unveil'd the summer heaven, blue and clear,
     Betwixt two marble shafts:—there they reposed,
     Where use had made it sweet, with eyelids closed,
     Saving a tythe which love still open kept,
     That they might see each other while they almost slept;
     When from the slope side of a suburb hill,
     Deafening the swallow's twitter, came a thrill
     Of trumpets—Lycius started—the sounds fled,
     But left a thought, a buzzing in his head.
     For the first time, since first he harbour'd in
     That purple-lined palace of sweet sin,
     His spirit pass'd beyond its golden bourn
     Into the noisy world almost forsworn.
     The lady, ever watchful, penetrant,
     Saw this with pain, so arguing a want
     Of something more, more than her empery
     Of joys; and she began to moan and sigh
     Because he mused beyond her, knowing well
     That but a moment's thought is passion's passing bell.
     "Why do you sigh, fair creature?" whisper'd he:
     "Why do you think?" return'd she tenderly:
     "You have deserted me—where am I now?
     Not in your heart while care weighs on your brow:
     No, no, you have dismiss'd me; and I go
     From your breast houseless: ay, it must be so."
     He answer'd, bending to her open eyes,
     Where he was mirror'd small in paradise,
     My silver planet, both of eve and morn!
     Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn,
     While I am striving how to fill my heart
     With deeper crimson, and a double smart?
     How to entangle, trammel up and snare
     Your soul in mine, and labyrinth you there
     Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose?
     Ay, a sweet kiss—you see your mighty woes.
     My thoughts! shall I unveil them? Listen then!
     What mortal hath a prize, that other men
     May be confounded and abash'd withal,
     But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical,
     And triumph, as in thee I should rejoice
     Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinth's voice.
     "Let my foes choke, and my friends shout afar,
     While through the thronged streets your bridal car
     Wheels round its dazzling spokes." The lady's cheek
     Trembled; she nothing said, but, pale and meek,
     Arose and knelt before him, wept a rain
     Of sorrows at his words; at last with pain
     Beseeching him, the while his hand she wrung,
     To change his purpose. He thereat was stung,
     Perverse, with stronger fancy to reclaim
     Her wild and timid nature to his aim:
     Besides, for all his love, in self despite,
     Against his better self, he took delight
     Luxurious in her sorrows, soft and new.
     His passion, cruel grown, took on a hue
     Fierce and sanguineous as 'twas possible
     In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell.
     Fine was the mitigated fury, like
     Apollo's presence when in act to strike
     The serpent—Ha, the serpent! certes, she
     Was none. She burnt, she lov'd the tyranny,
     And, all subdued, consented to the hour
     When to the bridal he should lead his paramour.
     Whispering in midnight silence, said the youth,
     "Sure some sweet name thou hast, though, by my truth,
     I have not ask'd it, ever thinking thee
     Not mortal, but of heavenly progeny,
     As still I do. Hast any mortal name,
     Fit appellation for this dazzling frame?
     Or friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth,
     To share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth?"
     "I have no friends," said Lamia," no, not one;
     My presence in wide Corinth hardly known:
     My parents' bones are in their dusty urns
     Sepulchred, where no kindled incense burns,
     Seeing all their luckless race are dead, save me,
     And I neglect the holy rite for thee.
     Even as you list invite your many guests;
     But if, as now it seems, your vision rests
     With any pleasure on me, do not bid
     Old Apollonius—from him keep me hid."
     Lycius, perplex'd at words so blind and blank,
     Made close inquiry; from whose touch she shrank,
     Feigning a sleep; and he to the dull shade
     Of deep sleep in a moment was betray'd

        It was the custom then to bring away
     The bride from home at blushing shut of day,
     Veil'd, in a chariot, heralded along
     By strewn flowers, torches, and a marriage song,
     With other pageants: but this fair unknown
     Had not a friend. So being left alone,
     (Lycius was gone to summon all his kin)
     And knowing surely she could never win
     His foolish heart from its mad pompousness,
     She set herself, high-thoughted, how to dress
     The misery in fit magnificence.
     She did so, but 'tis doubtful how and whence
     Came, and who were her subtle servitors.
     About the halls, and to and from the doors,
     There was a noise of wings, till in short space
     The glowing banquet-room shone with wide-arched grace.
     A haunting music, sole perhaps and lone
     Supportress of the faery-roof, made moan
     Throughout, as fearful the whole charm might fade.
     Fresh carved cedar, mimicking a glade
     Of palm and plantain, met from either side,
     High in the midst, in honour of the bride:
     Two palms and then two plantains, and so on,
     From either side their stems branch'd one to one
     All down the aisled place; and beneath all
     There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall.
     So canopied, lay an untasted feast
     Teeming with odours. Lamia, regal drest,
     Silently paced about, and as she went,
     In pale contented sort of discontent,
     Mission'd her viewless servants to enrich
     The fretted splendour of each nook and niche.
     Between the tree-stems, marbled plain at first,
     Came jasper pannels; then, anon, there burst
     Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees,
     And with the larger wove in small intricacies.
     Approving all, she faded at self-will,
     And shut the chamber up, close, hush'd and still,
     Complete and ready for the revels rude,
     When dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude.

        The day appear'd, and all the gossip rout.
     O senseless Lycius! Madman! wherefore flout
     The silent-blessing fate, warm cloister'd hours,
     And show to common eyes these secret bowers?
     The herd approach'd; each guest, with busy brain,
     Arriving at the portal, gaz'd amain,
     And enter'd marveling: for they knew the street,
     Remember'd it from childhood all complete
     Without a gap, yet ne'er before had seen
     That royal porch, that high-built fair demesne;
     So in they hurried all, maz'd, curious and keen:
     Save one, who look'd thereon with eye severe,
     And with calm-planted steps walk'd in austere;
     'Twas Apollonius: something too he laugh'd,
     As though some knotty problem, that had daft
     His patient thought, had now begun to thaw,
     And solve and melt—'twas just as he foresaw.

        He met within the murmurous vestibule
     His young disciple. "'Tis no common rule,
     Lycius," said he, "for uninvited guest
     To force himself upon you, and infest
     With an unbidden presence the bright throng
     Of younger friends; yet must I do this wrong,
     And you forgive me." Lycius blush'd, and led
     The old man through the inner doors broad-spread;
     With reconciling words and courteous mien
     Turning into sweet milk the sophist's spleen.

        Of wealthy lustre was the banquet-room,
     Fill'd with pervading brilliance and perfume:
     Before each lucid pannel fuming stood
     A censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood,
     Each by a sacred tripod held aloft,
     Whose slender feet wide-swerv'd upon the soft
     Wool-woofed carpets: fifty wreaths of smoke
     From fifty censers their light voyage took
     To the high roof, still mimick'd as they rose
     Along the mirror'd walls by twin-clouds odorous.
     Twelve sphered tables, by silk seats insphered,
     High as the level of a man's breast rear'd
     On libbard's paws, upheld the heavy gold
     Of cups and goblets, and the store thrice told
     Of Ceres' horn, and, in huge vessels, wine
     Come from the gloomy tun with merry shine.
     Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood,
     Each shrining in the midst the image of a God.

        When in an antichamber every guest
     Had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure press'd,
     By minist'ring slaves, upon his hands and feet,
     And fragrant oils with ceremony meet
     Pour'd on his hair, they all mov'd to the feast
     In white robes, and themselves in order placed
     Around the silken couches, wondering
     Whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring.

        Soft went the music the soft air along,
     While fluent Greek a vowel'd undersong
     Kept up among the guests discoursing low
     At first, for scarcely was the wine at flow;
     But when the happy vintage touch'd their brains,
     Louder they talk, and louder come the strains
     Of powerful instruments—the gorgeous dyes,
     The space, the splendour of the draperies,
     The roof of awful richness, nectarous cheer,
     Beautiful slaves, and Lamia's self, appear,
     Now, when the wine has done its rosy deed,
     And every soul from human trammels freed,
     No more so strange; for merry wine, sweet wine,
     Will make Elysian shades not too fair, too divine.
     Soon was God Bacchus at meridian height;
     Flush'd were their cheeks, and bright eyes double bright:
     Garlands of every green, and every scent
     From vales deflower'd, or forest-trees branch rent,
     In baskets of bright osier'd gold were brought
     High as the handles heap'd, to suit the thought
     Of every guest; that each, as he did please,
     Might fancy-fit his brows, silk-pillow'd at his ease.

        What wreath for Lamia? What for Lycius?
     What for the sage, old Apollonius?
     Upon her aching forehead be there hung
     The leaves of willow and of adder's tongue;
     And for the youth, quick, let us strip for him
     The thyrsus, that his watching eyes may swim
     Into forgetfulness; and, for the sage,
     Let spear-grass and the spiteful thistle wage
     War on his temples. Do not all charms fly
     At the mere touch of cold philosophy?
     There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:
     We know her woof, her texture; she is given
     In the dull catalogue of common things.
     Philosophy will clip an Angel's wings,
     Conquer all mysteries by rule and line,
     Empty the haunted air, and gnomed mine—
     Unweave a rainbow, as it erewhile made
     The tender-person'd Lamia melt into a shade.

        By her glad Lycius sitting, in chief place,
     Scarce saw in all the room another face,
     Till, checking his love trance, a cup he took
     Full brimm'd, and opposite sent forth a look
     'Cross the broad table, to beseech a glance
     From his old teacher's wrinkled countenance,
     And pledge him. The bald-head philosopher
     Had fix'd his eye, without a twinkle or stir
     Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride,
     Brow-beating her fair form, and troubling her sweet pride.
     Lycius then press'd her hand, with devout touch,
     As pale it lay upon the rosy couch:
     'Twas icy, and the cold ran through his veins;
     Then sudden it grew hot, and all the pains
     Of an unnatural heat shot to his heart.
     "Lamia, what means this? Wherefore dost thou start?
     Know'st thou that man?" Poor Lamia answer'd not.
     He gaz'd into her eyes, and not a jot
     Own'd they the lovelorn piteous appeal:
     More, more he gaz'd: his human senses reel:
     Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs;
     There was no recognition in those orbs.
     "Lamia!" he cried—and no soft-toned reply.
     The many heard, and the loud revelry
     Grew hush; the stately music no more breathes;
     The myrtle sicken'd in a thousand wreaths.
     By faint degrees, voice, lute, and pleasure ceased;
     A deadly silence step by step increased,
     Until it seem'd a horrid presence there,
     And not a man but felt the terror in his hair.
     "Lamia!" he shriek'd; and nothing but the shriek
     With its sad echo did the silence break.
     "Begone, foul dream!" he cried, gazing again
     In the bride's face, where now no azure vein
     Wander'd on fair-spaced temples; no soft bloom
     Misted the cheek; no passion to illume
     The deep-recessed vision—all was blight;
     Lamia, no longer fair, there sat a deadly white.
     "Shut, shut those juggling eyes, thou ruthless man!
     Turn them aside, wretch! or the righteous ban
     Of all the Gods, whose dreadful images
     Here represent their shadowy presences,
     May pierce them on the sudden with the thorn
     Of painful blindness; leaving thee forlorn,
     In trembling dotage to the feeblest fright
     Of conscience, for their long offended might,
     For all thine impious proud-heart sophistries,
     Unlawful magic, and enticing lies.
     Corinthians! look upon that gray-beard wretch!
     Mark how, possess'd, his lashless eyelids stretch
     Around his demon eyes! Corinthians, see!
     My sweet bride withers at their potency."
     "Fool!" said the sophist, in an under-tone
     Gruff with contempt; which a death-nighing moan
     From Lycius answer'd, as heart-struck and lost,
     He sank supine beside the aching ghost.
     "Fool! Fool!" repeated he, while his eyes still
     Relented not, nor mov'd; "from every ill
     Of life have I preserv'd thee to this day,
     And shall I see thee made a serpent's prey?"
     Then Lamia breath'd death breath; the sophist's eye,
     Like a sharp spear, went through her utterly,
     Keen, cruel, perceant, stinging: she, as well
     As her weak hand could any meaning tell,
     Motion'd him to be silent; vainly so,
     He look'd and look'd again a level—No!
     "A Serpent!" echoed he; no sooner said,
     Than with a frightful scream she vanished:
     And Lycius' arms were empty of delight,
     As were his limbs of life, from that same night.
     On the high couch he lay!—his friends came round
     Supported him—no pulse, or breath they found,
     And, in its marriage robe, the heavy body wound.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

        Than to enjoy delight with liberty."
Fate of the Butterfly.—SPENSER.




DEDICATION.

TO LEIGH HUNT, ESQ.


Glory and loveliness have passed away;
  For if we wander out in early morn,
  No wreathed incense do we see upborne
Into the east, to meet the smiling day:
No crowd of nymphs soft voic'd and young, and gay,
  In woven baskets bringing ears of corn,
  Roses, and pinks, and violets, to adorn
The shrine of Flora in her early May.
But there are left delights as high as these,
  And I shall ever bless my destiny,
That in a time, when under pleasant trees
  Pan is no longer sought, I feel a free
A leafy luxury, seeing I could please
  With these poor offerings, a man like thee.



[The Short Pieces in the middle of the Book, as well as some of the Sonnets,
were written at an earlier period than the rest of the Poems.]





POEMS.


"Places of nestling green for Poets made."
                           STORY OF RIMINI.


I stood tip-toe upon a little hill,
The air was cooling, and so very still.
That the sweet buds which with a modest pride
Pull droopingly, in slanting curve aside,
Their scantly leaved, and finely tapering stems,
Had not yet lost those starry diadems
Caught from the early sobbing of the morn.
The clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn,
And fresh from the clear brook; sweetly they slept
On the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept
A little noiseless noise among the leaves,
Born of the very sigh that silence heaves:
For not the faintest motion could be seen
Of all the shades that slanted o'er the green.
There was wide wand'ring for the greediest eye,
To peer about upon variety;
Far round the horizon's crystal air to skim,
And trace the dwindled edgings of its brim;
To picture out the quaint, and curious bending
Of a fresh woodland alley, never ending;
Or by the bowery clefts, and leafy shelves,
Guess were the jaunty streams refresh themselves.
I gazed awhile, and felt as light, and free
As though the fanning wings of Mercury
Had played upon my heels: I was light-hearted,
And many pleasures to my vision started;
So I straightway began to pluck a posey
Of luxuries bright, milky, soft and rosy.

A bush of May flowers with the bees about them;
Ah, sure no tasteful nook would be without them;
And let a lush laburnum oversweep them,
And let long grass grow round the roots to keep them
Moist, cool and green; and shade the violets,
That they may bind the moss in leafy nets.

A filbert hedge with wild briar overtwined,
And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind
Upon their summer thrones; there too should be
The frequent chequer of a youngling tree,
That with a score of light green brethen shoots
From the quaint mossiness of aged roots:
Round which is heard a spring-head of clear waters
Babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters
The spreading blue bells: it may haply mourn
That such fair clusters should be rudely torn
From their fresh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly
By infant hands, left on the path to die.

Open afresh your round of starry folds,
Ye ardent marigolds!
Dry up the moisture from your golden lids,
For great Apollo bids
That in these days your praises should be sung
On many harps, which he has lately strung;
And when again your dewiness he kisses,
Tell him, I have you in my world of blisses:
So haply when I rove in some far vale,
His mighty voice may come upon the gale.

Here are sweet peas, on tip-toe for a flight:
With wings of gentle flush o'er delicate white,
And taper fulgent catching at all things,
To bind them all about with tiny rings.

Linger awhile upon some bending planks
That lean against a streamlet's rushy banks,
And watch intently Nature's gentle doings:
They will be found softer than ring-dove's cooings.
How silent comes the water round that bend;
Not the minutest whisper does it send
To the o'erhanging sallows: blades of grass
Slowly across the chequer'd shadows pass.
Why, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach
To where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach
A natural sermon o'er their pebbly beds;
Where swarms of minnows show their little heads,
Staying their wavy bodies 'gainst the streams,
To taste the luxury of sunny beams
Temper'd with coolness. How they ever wrestle
With their own sweet delight, and ever nestle
Their silver bellies on the pebbly sand.
If you but scantily hold out the hand,
That very instant not one will remain;
But turn your eye, and they are there again.
The ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses,
And cool themselves among the em'rald tresses;
The while they cool themselves, they freshness give,
And moisture, that the bowery green may live:
So keeping up an interchange of favours,
Like good men in the truth of their behaviours
Sometimes goldfinches one by one will drop
From low hung branches; little space they stop;
But sip, and twitter, and their feathers sleek;
Then off at once, as in a wanton freak:
Or perhaps, to show their black, and golden wings,
Pausing upon their yellow flutterings.
Were I in such a place, I sure should pray
That nought less sweet, might call my thoughts away,
Than the soft rustle of a maiden's gown
Fanning away the dandelion's down;
Than the light music of her nimble toes
Patting against the sorrel as she goes.
How she would start, and blush, thus to be caught
Playing in all her innocence of thought.
O let me lead her gently o'er the brook,
Watch her half-smiling lips, and downward look;
O let me for one moment touch her wrist;
Let me one moment to her breathing list;
And as she leaves me may she often turn
Her fair eyes looking through her locks aubùrne.
What next? A tuft of evening primroses,
O'er which the mind may hover till it dozes;
O'er which it well might take a pleasant sleep,
But that 'tis ever startled by the leap
Of buds into ripe flowers; or by the flitting
Of diverse moths, that aye their rest are quitting;
Or by the moon lifting her silver rim
Above a cloud, and with a gradual swim
Coming into the blue with all her light.
O Maker of sweet poets, dear delight
Of this fair world, and all its gentle livers;
Spangler of clouds, halo of crystal rivers,
Mingler with leaves, and dew and tumbling streams,
Closer of lovely eyes to lovely dreams,
Lover of loneliness, and wandering,
Of upcast eye, and tender pondering!
Thee must I praise above all other glories
That smile us on to tell delightful stories.
For what has made the sage or poet write
But the fair paradise of Nature's light?
In the calm grandeur of a sober line,
We see the waving of the mountain pine;
And when a tale is beautifully staid,
We feel the safety of a hawthorn glade:
When it is moving on luxurious wings,
The soul is lost in pleasant smotherings:
Fair dewy roses brush against our faces,
And flowering laurels spring from diamond vases;
O'er head we see the jasmine and sweet briar,
And bloomy grapes laughing from green attire;
While at our feet, the voice of crystal bubbles
Charms us at once away from all our troubles:
So that we feel uplifted from the world,
Walking upon the white clouds wreath'd and curl'd.
So felt he, who first told, how Psyche went
On the smooth wind to realms of wonderment;
What Psyche felt, and Love, when their full lips
First touch'd; what amorous, and fondling nips
They gave each other's cheeks; with all their sighs,
And how they kist each other's tremulous eyes:
The silver lamp,—the ravishment,—the wonder—
The darkness,—loneliness,—the fearful thunder;
Their woes gone by, and both to heaven upflown,
To bow for gratitude before Jove's throne.
So did he feel, who pull'd the boughs aside,
That we might look into a forest wide,
To catch a glimpse of Fawns, and Dryades
Coming with softest rustle through the trees;
And garlands woven of flowers wild, and sweet,
Upheld on ivory wrists, or sporting feet:
Telling us how fair, trembling Syrinx fled
Arcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread.
Poor nymph,—poor Pan,—how he did weep to find,
Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind
Along the reedy stream; a half heard strain,
Full of sweet desolation—balmy pain.

What first inspired a bard of old to sing
Narcissus pining o'er the untainted spring?
In some delicious ramble, he had found
A little space, with boughs all woven round;
And in the midst of all, a clearer pool
Than e'er reflected in its pleasant cool,
The blue sky here, and there, serenely peeping
Through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping.
And on the bank a lonely flower he spied,
A meek and forlorn flower, with naught of pride,
Drooping its beauty o'er the watery clearness,
To woo its own sad image into nearness:
Deaf to light Zephyrus it would not move;
But still would seem to droop, to pine, to love.
So while the Poet stood in this sweet spot,
Some fainter gleamings o'er his fancy shot;
Nor was it long ere he had told the tale
Of young Narcissus, and sad Echo's bale.

Where had he been, from whose warm head out-flew
That sweetest of all songs, that ever new,
That aye refreshing, pure deliciousness,
Coming ever to bless
The wanderer by moonlight? to him bringing
Shapes from the invisible world, unearthly singing
From out the middle air, from flowery nests,
And from the pillowy silkiness that rests
Full in the speculation of the stars.
Ah! surely he had burst our mortal bars;
Into some wond'rous region he had gone,
To search for thee, divine Endymion!

He was a Poet, sure a lover too,
Who stood on Latmus' top, what time there blew
Soft breezes from the myrtle vale below;
And brought in faintness solemn, sweet, and slow
A hymn from Dian's temple; while upswelling,
The incense went to her own starry dwelling.
But though her face was clear as infant's eyes,
Though she stood smiling o'er the sacrifice,
The Poet wept at her so piteous fate,
Wept that such beauty should be desolate:
So in fine wrath some golden sounds he won,
And gave meek Cynthia her Endymion.

Queen of the wide air; thou most lovely queen
Of all the brightness that mine eyes have seen!
As thou exceedest all things in thy shine,
So every tale, does this sweet tale of thine.
O for three words of honey, that I might
Tell but one wonder of thy bridal night!

Where distant ships do seem to show their keels,
Phoebus awhile delayed his mighty wheels,
And turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes,
Ere he his unseen pomp would solemnize.
The evening weather was so bright, and clear,
That men of health were of unusual cheer;
Stepping like Homer at the trumpet's call,
Or young Apollo on the pedestal:
And lovely women were as fair and warm,
As Venus looking sideways in alarm.
The breezes were ethereal, and pure,
And crept through half closed lattices to cure
The languid sick; it cool'd their fever'd sleep,
And soothed them into slumbers full and deep.
Soon they awoke clear eyed: nor burnt with thirsting,
Nor with hot fingers, nor with temples bursting:
And springing up, they met the wond'ring sight
Of their dear friends, nigh foolish with delight;
Who feel their arms, and breasts, and kiss and stare,
And on their placid foreheads part the hair.
Young men, and maidens at each other gaz'd
With hands held back, and motionless, amaz'd
To see the brightness in each others' eyes;
And so they stood, fill'd with a sweet surprise,
Until their tongues were loos'd in poesy.
Therefore no lover did of anguish die:
But the soft numbers, in that moment spoken,
Made silken ties, that never may be broken.
Cynthia! I cannot tell the greater blisses,
That follow'd thine, and thy dear shepherd's kisses:
Was there a Poet born?—but now no more,
My wand'ring spirit must no further soar.—




SPECIMEN
OF AN
INDUCTION TO A POEM.

Lo! I must tell a tale of chivalry;
For large white plumes are dancing in mine eye.
Not like the formal crest of latter days:
But bending in a thousand graceful ways;
So graceful, that it seems no mortal hand,
Or e'en the touch of Archimago's wand,
Could charm them into such an attitude.
We must think rather, that in playful mood,
Some mountain breeze had turned its chief delight,
To show this wonder of its gentle might.
Lo! I must tell a tale of chivalry;
For while I muse, the lance points slantingly
Athwart the morning air: some lady sweet,
Who cannot feel for cold her tender feet,
From the worn top of some old battlement
Hails it with tears, her stout defender sent:
And from her own pure self no joy dissembling,
Wraps round her ample robe with happy trembling.
Sometimes, when the good Knight his rest would take,
It is reflected, clearly, in a lake,
With the young ashen boughs, 'gainst which it rests,
And th' half seen mossiness of linnets' nests.
Ah! shall I ever tell its cruelty,
When the fire flashes from a warrior's eye,
And his tremendous hand is grasping it,
And his dark brow for very wrath is knit?
Or when his spirit, with more calm intent,
Leaps to the honors of a tournament,
And makes the gazers round about the ring
Stare at the grandeur of the balancing?
No, no! this is far off:—then how shall I
Revive the dying tones of minstrelsy,
Which linger yet about lone gothic arches,
In dark green ivy, and among wild larches?
How sing the splendour of the revelries,
When buts of wine are drunk off to the lees?
And that bright lance, against the fretted wall,
Beneath the shade of stately banneral,
Is slung with shining cuirass, sword, and shield?
Where ye may see a spur in bloody field.
Light-footed damsels move with gentle paces
Round the wide hall, and show their happy faces;
Or stand in courtly talk by fives and sevens:
Like those fair stars that twinkle in the heavens.
Yet must I tell a tale of chivalry:
Or wherefore comes that knight so proudly by?
Wherefore more proudly does the gentle knight,
Rein in the swelling of his ample might?

Spenser! thy brows are arched, open, kind,
And come like a clear sun-rise to my mind;
And always does my heart with pleasure dance,
When I think on thy noble countenance:
Where never yet was ought more earthly seen
Than the pure freshness of thy laurels green.
Therefore, great bard, I not so fearfully
Call on thy gentle spirit to hover nigh
My daring steps: or if thy tender care,
Thus startled unaware,
Be jealous that the foot of other wight
Should madly follow that bright path of light
Trac'd by thy lov'd Libertas; he will speak,
And tell thee that my prayer is very meek;
That I will follow with due reverence,
And start with awe at mine own strange pretence.
Him thou wilt hear; so I will rest in hope
To see wide plains, fair trees and lawny slope:
The morn, the eve, the light, the shade, the flowers:
Clear streams, smooth lakes, and overlooking towers.




CALIDORE.

A Fragment.

Young Calidore is paddling o'er the lake;
His healthful spirit eager and awake
To feel the beauty of a silent eve,
Which seem'd full loath this happy world to leave;
The light dwelt o'er the scene so lingeringly.
He bares his forehead to the cool blue sky,
And smiles at the far clearness all around,
Until his heart is well nigh over wound,
And turns for calmness to the pleasant green
Of easy slopes, and shadowy trees that lean
So elegantly o'er the waters' brim
And show their blossoms trim.
Scarce can his clear and nimble eye-sight follow
The freaks, and dartings of the black-wing'd swallow,
Delighting much, to see it half at rest,
Dip so refreshingly its wings, and breast
'Gainst the smooth surface, and to mark anon,
The widening circles into nothing gone.

And now the sharp keel of his little boat
Comes up with ripple, and with easy float,
And glides into a bed of water lillies:
Broad leav'd are they and their white canopies
Are upward turn'd to catch the heavens' dew.
Near to a little island's point they grew;
Whence Calidore might have the goodliest view
Of this sweet spot of earth. The bowery shore
Went off in gentle windings to the hoar
And light blue mountains: but no breathing man
With a warm heart, and eye prepared to scan
Nature's clear beauty, could pass lightly by
Objects that look'd out so invitingly
On either side. These, gentle Calidore
Greeted, as he had known them long before.

The sidelong view of swelling leafiness,
Which the glad setting sun, in gold doth dress;
Whence ever, and anon the jay outsprings,
And scales upon the beauty of its wings.

The lonely turret, shatter'd, and outworn,
Stands venerably proud; too proud to mourn
Its long lost grandeur: fir trees grow around,
Aye dropping their hard fruit upon the ground.

The little chapel with the cross above
Upholding wreaths of ivy; the white dove,
That on the windows spreads his feathers light,
And seems from purple clouds to wing its flight.

Green tufted islands casting their soft shades
Across the lake; sequester'd leafy glades,
That through the dimness of their twilight show
Large dock leaves, spiral foxgloves, or the glow
Of the wild cat's eyes, or the silvery stems
Of delicate birch trees, or long grass which hems
A little brook. The youth had long been viewing
These pleasant things, and heaven was bedewing
The mountain flowers, when his glad senses caught
A trumpet's silver voice. Ah! it was fraught
With many joys for him: the warder's ken
Had found white coursers prancing in the glen:
Friends very dear to him he soon will see;
So pushes off his boat most eagerly,
And soon upon the lake he skims along,
Deaf to the nightingale's first under-song;
Nor minds he the white swans that dream so sweetly:
His spirit flies before him so completely.

And now he turns a jutting point of land,
Whence may be seen the castle gloomy, and grand:
Nor will a bee buzz round two swelling peaches,
Before the point of his light shallop reaches
Those marble steps that through the water dip:
Now over them he goes with hasty trip,
And scarcely stays to ope the folding doors:
Anon he leaps along the oaken floors
Of halls and corridors.

Delicious sounds! those little bright-eyed things
That float about the air on azure wings,
Had been less heartfelt by him than the clang
Of clattering hoofs; into the court he sprang,
Just as two noble steeds, and palfreys twain,
Were slanting out their necks with loosened rein;
While from beneath the threat'ning portcullis
They brought their happy burthens. What a kiss,
What gentle squeeze he gave each lady's hand!
How tremblingly their delicate ancles spann'd!
Into how sweet a trance his soul was gone,
While whisperings of affection
Made him delay to let their tender feet
Come to the earth; with an incline so sweet
From their low palfreys o'er his neck they bent:
And whether there were tears of languishment,
Or that the evening dew had pearl'd their tresses,
He feels a moisture on his cheek, and blesses
With lips that tremble, and with glistening eye
All the soft luxury
That nestled in his arms. A dimpled hand,
Fair as some wonder out of fairy land,
Hung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers
Of whitest Cassia, fresh from summer showers:
And this he fondled with his happy cheek
As if for joy he would no further seek;
When the kind voice of good Sir Clerimond
Came to his ear, like something from beyond
His present being: so he gently drew
His warm arms, thrilling now with pulses new,
From their sweet thrall, and forward gently bending,
Thank'd heaven that his joy was never ending;
While 'gainst his forehead he devoutly press'd
A hand heaven made to succour the distress'd;
A hand that from the world's bleak promontory
Had lifted Calidore for deeds of glory.

Amid the pages, and the torches' glare,
There stood a knight, patting the flowing hair
Of his proud horse's mane: he was withal
A man of elegance, and stature tall:
So that the waving of his plumes would be
High as the berries of a wild ash tree,
Or as the winged cap of Mercury.
His armour was so dexterously wrought
In shape, that sure no living man had thought
It hard, and heavy steel: but that indeed
It was some glorious form, some splendid weed,
In which a spirit new come from the skies
Might live, and show itself to human eyes.
'Tis the far-fam'd, the brave Sir Gondibert,
Said the good man to Calidore alert;
While the young warrior with a step of grace
Came up,—a courtly smile upon his face,
And mailed hand held out, ready to greet
The large-eyed wonder, and ambitious heat
Of the aspiring boy; who as he led
Those smiling ladies, often turned his head
To admire the visor arched so gracefully
Over a knightly brow; while they went by
The lamps that from the high-roof'd hall were pendent,
And gave the steel a shining quite transcendent.

Soon in a pleasant chamber they are seated;
The sweet-lipp'd ladies have already greeted
All the green leaves that round the window clamber,
To show their purple stars, and bells of amber.
Sir Gondibert has doff'd his shining steel,
Gladdening in the free, and airy feel
Of a light mantle; and while Clerimond
Is looking round about him with a fond,
And placid eye, young Calidore is burning
To hear of knightly deeds, and gallant spurning
Of all unworthiness; and how the strong of arm
Kept off dismay, and terror, and alarm
From lovely woman: while brimful of this,
He gave each damsel's hand so warm a kiss,
And had such manly ardour in his eye,
That each at other look'd half staringly;
And then their features started into smiles
Sweet as blue heavens o'er enchanted isles.

Softly the breezes from the forest came,
Softly they blew aside the taper's flame;
Clear was the song from Philomel's far bower;
Grateful the incense from the lime-tree flower;
Mysterious, wild, the far heard trumpet's tone;
Lovely the moon in ether, all alone:
Sweet too the converse of these happy mortals,
As that of busy spirits when the portals
Are closing in the west; or that soft humming
We hear around when Hesperus is coming.
Sweet be their sleep. * * * * * * * * *




TO

SOME LADIES.

What though while the wonders of nature exploring,
  I cannot your light, mazy footsteps attend;
Nor listen to accents, that almost adoring,
  Bless Cynthia's face, the enthusiast's friend:

Yet over the steep, whence the mountain stream rushes,
  With you, kindest friends, in idea I rove;
Mark the clear tumbling crystal, its passionate gushes,
  Its spray that the wild flower kindly bedews.

Why linger you so, the wild labyrinth strolling?
  Why breathless, unable your bliss to declare?
Ah! you list to the nightingale's tender condoling,
  Responsive to sylphs, in the moon beamy air.

'Tis morn, and the flowers with dew are yet drooping,
  I see you are treading the verge of the sea:
And now! ah, I see it—you just now are stooping
  To pick up the keep-sake intended for me.

If a cherub, on pinions of silver descending,
  Had brought me a gem from the fret-work of heaven;
And smiles, with his star-cheering voice sweetly blending,
  The blessings of Tighe had melodiously given;

It had not created a warmer emotion
  Than the present, fair nymphs, I was blest with from you,
Than the shell, from the bright golden sands of the ocean
  Which the emerald waves at your feet gladly threw.

For, indeed, 'tis a sweet and peculiar pleasure,
  (And blissful is he who such happiness finds,)
To possess but a span of the hour of leisure,
  In elegant, pure, and aerial minds.




On receiving a curious Shell, and a Copy of Verses,
from the same Ladies.

Hast thou from the caves of Golconda, a gem
  Pure as the ice-drop that froze on the mountain?
Bright as the humming-bird's green diadem,
  When it flutters in sun-beams that shine through a fountain?

Hast thou a goblet for dark sparkling wine?
  That goblet right heavy, and massy, and gold?
And splendidly mark'd with the story divine
  Of Armida the fair, and Rinaldo the bold?

Hast thou a steed with a mane richly flowing?
  Hast thou a sword that thine enemy's smart is?
Hast thou a trumpet rich melodies blowing?
  And wear'st thou the shield of the fam'd Britomartis?

What is it that hangs from thy shoulder, so brave,
  Embroidered with many a spring peering flower?
Is it a scarf that thy fair lady gave?
  And hastest thou now to that fair lady's bower?

Ah! courteous Sir Knight, with large joy thou art crown'd;
  Full many the glories that brighten thy youth!
I will tell thee my blisses, which richly abound
  In magical powers to bless, and to sooth.

On this scroll thou seest written in characters fair
  A sun-beamy tale of a wreath, and a chain;
And, warrior, it nurtures the property rare
  Of charming my mind from the trammels of pain.

This canopy mark: 'tis the work of a fay;
  Beneath its rich shade did King Oberon languish,
When lovely Titania was far, far away,
  And cruelly left him to sorrow, and anguish.

There, oft would he bring from his soft sighing lute
  Wild strains to which, spell-bound, the nightingales listened;
The wondering spirits of heaven were mute,
  And tears 'mong the dewdrops of morning oft glistened.

In this little dome, all those melodies strange,
  Soft, plaintive, and melting, for ever will sigh;
Nor e'er will the notes from their tenderness change;
  Nor e'er will the music of Oberon die.

So, when I am in a voluptuous vein,
  I pillow my head on the sweets of the rose,
And list to the tale of the wreath, and the chain,
  Till its echoes depart; then I sink to repose.

Adieu, valiant Eric! with joy thou art crown'd;
  Full many the glories that brighten thy youth,
I too have my blisses, which richly abound
  In magical powers, to bless and to sooth.



.

TO  * * * *

Hadst thou liv'd in days of old,
O what wonders had been told
Of thy lively countenance,
And thy humid eyes that dance
In the  midst of their own brightness;
In the very fane of lightness.
Over which thine eyebrows, leaning,
Picture out each lovely meaning:
In a dainty bend they lie,
Like two streaks across the sky,
Or the feathers from a crow,
Fallen on a bed of snow.
Of thy dark hair that extends
Into many graceful bends:
As the leaves of Hellebore
Turn to whence they sprung before.
And behind each ample curl
Peeps the richness of a pearl.
Downward too flows many a tress
With a glossy waviness;
Full, and round like globes that rise
From the censer to the skies
Through sunny air. Add too, the sweetness
Of thy honied voice; the neatness
Of thine ankle lightly turn'd:
With those beauties, scarce discrn'd,
Kept with such sweet privacy,
That they seldom meet the eye
Of the little loves that fly
Round about with eager pry.
Saving when, with freshening lave,
Thou dipp'st them in the taintless wave;
Like twin water lillies, born
In the coolness of the morn.
O, if thou hadst breathed then,
Now the Muses had been ten.
Couldst thou wish for lineage higher
Than twin sister of Thalia?
At least for ever, evermore,
Will I call the Graces four.

Hadst thou liv'd when chivalry
Lifted up her lance on high,
Tell me what thou wouldst have been?
Ah! I see the silver sheen
Of thy broidered, floating vest
Cov'ring half thine ivory breast;
Which, O heavens! I should see,
But that cruel destiny
Has placed a golden cuirass there;
Keeping secret what is fair.
Like sunbeams in a cloudlet nested
Thy locks in knightly casque are rested:
O'er which bend four milky plumes
Like the gentle lilly's blooms
Springing from a costly vase.
See with what a stately pace
Comes thine alabaster steed;
Servant of heroic deed!
O'er his loins, his trappings glow
Like the northern lights on snow.
Mount his back! thy sword unsheath!
Sign of the enchanter's death;
Bane of every wicked spell;
Silencer of dragon's yell.
Alas! thou this wilt never do:
Thou art an enchantress too,
And wilt surely never spill
Blood of those whose eyes can kill.




TO

HOPE.

When by my solitary hearth I sit,
  And hateful thoughts enwrap my soul in gloom;
When no fair dreams before my "mind's eye" flit,
  And the bare heath of life presents no bloom;
    Sweet Hope, ethereal balm upon me shed,
    And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head.

Whene'er I wander, at the fall of night,
  Where woven boughs shut out the moon's bright ray,
Should sad Despondency my musings fright,
  And frown, to drive fair Cheerfulness away,
    Peep with the moon-beams through the leafy roof,
    And keep that fiend Despondence far aloof.

Should Disappointment, parent of Despair,
  Strive for her son to seize my careless heart;
When, like a cloud, he sits upon the air,
  Preparing on his spell-bound prey to dart:
    Chace him away, sweet Hope, with visage bright,
    And fright him as the morning frightens night!

Whene'er the fate of those I hold most dear
  Tells to my fearful breast a tale of sorrow,
O bright-eyed Hope, my morbid fancy cheer;
  Let me awhile thy sweetest comforts borrow:
    Thy heaven-born radiance around me shed,
    And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head!

Should e'er unhappy love my bosom pain,
  From cruel parents, or relentless fair;
O let me think it is not quite in vain
  To sigh out sonnets to the midnight air!
    Sweet Hope, ethereal balm upon me shed.
    And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head!

In the long vista of the years to roll,
  Let me not see our country's honour fade:
O let me see our land retain her soul,
  Her pride, her freedom; and not freedom's shade.
    From thy bright eyes unusual brightness shed—
    Beneath thy pinions canopy my head!

Let me not see the patriot's high bequest,
  Great Liberty! how great in plain attire!
With the base purple of a court oppress'd,
  Bowing her head, and ready to expire:
    But let me see thee stoop from heaven on wings
    That fill the skies with silver glitterings!

And as, in sparkling majesty, a star
  Gilds the bright summit of some gloomy cloud;
Brightening the half veil'd face of heaven afar:
  So, when dark thoughts my boding spirit shroud,
    Sweet Hope, celestial influence round me shed,
    Waving thy silver pinions o'er my head.

February, 1815.




IMITATION OF SPENSER.

Now Morning from her orient chamber came,
  And her first footsteps touch'd a verdant hill;
  Crowning its lawny crest with amber flame,
  Silv'ring the untainted gushes of its rill;
  Which, pure from mossy beds, did down distill,
  And after parting beds of simple flowers,
  By many streams a little lake did fill,
  Which round its marge reflected woven bowers,
And, in its middle space, a sky that never lowers.

  There the king-fisher saw his plumage bright
  Vieing with fish of brilliant dye below;
  Whose silken fins, and golden scales' light
  Cast upward, through the waves, a ruby glow:
  There saw the swan his neck of arched snow,
  And oar'd himself along with majesty;
  Sparkled his jetty eyes; his feet did show
  Beneath the waves like Afric's ebony,
And on his back a fay reclined voluptuously.

  Ah! could I tell the wonders of an isle
  That in that fairest lake had placed been,
  I could e'en Dido of her grief beguile;
  Or rob from aged Lear his bitter teen:
  For sure so fair a place was never seen,
  Of all that ever charm'd romantic eye:
  It seem'd an emerald in the silver sheen
  Of the bright waters; or as when on high,
Through clouds of fleecy white, laughs the coerulean sky.

  And all around it dipp'd luxuriously
  Slopings of verdure through the glossy tide,
  Which, as it were in gentle amity,
  Rippled delighted up the flowery side;
  As if to glean the ruddy tears, it tried,
  Which fell profusely from the rose-tree stem!
  Haply it was the workings of its pride,
  In strife to throw upon the shore a gem
Outvieing all the buds in Flora's diadem.




Woman! when I behold thee flippant, vain,
  Inconstant, childish, proud, and full of fancies;
  Without that modest softening that enhances
The downcast eye, repentant of the pain
That its mild light creates to heal again:
  E'en then, elate, my spirit leaps, and prances,
  E'en then my soul with exultation dances
For that to love, so long, I've dormant lain:
But when I see thee meek, and kind, and tender,
  Heavens! how desperately do I adore
Thy winning graces;—to be thy defender
  I hotly burn—to be a Calidore—
A very Red Cross Knight—a stout Leander—
  Might I be loved by thee like these of yore.

Light feet, dark violet eyes, and parted hair;
  Soft dimpled hands, white neck, and creamy breast,
  Are things on which the dazzled senses rest
Till the fond, fixed eyes, forget they stare.
From such fine pictures, heavens! I cannot dare
  To turn my admiration, though unpossess'd
  They be of what is worthy,—though not drest
In lovely modesty, and virtues rare.
Yet these I leave as thoughtless as a lark;
  These lures I straight forget,—e'en ere I dine,
Or thrice my palate moisten: but when I mark
  Such charms with mild intelligences shine,
My ear is open like a greedy shark,
  To catch the tunings of a voice divine.

Ah! who can e'er forget so fair a being?
  Who can forget her half retiring sweets?
  God! she is like a milk-white lamb that bleats
For man's protection. Surely the All-seeing,
Who joys to see us with his gifts agreeing,
  Will never give him pinions, who intreats
  Such innocence to ruin,—who vilely cheats
A dove-like bosom. In truth there is no freeing
One's thoughts from such a beauty; when I hear
  A lay that once I saw her hand awake,
Her form seems floating palpable, and near;
  Had I e'er seen her from an arbour take
A dewy flower, oft would that hand appear,
  And o'er my eyes the trembling moisture shake.

 Yet hartned to his pipe) with all the skill

TO

GEORGE FELTON MATHEW.

Sweet are the pleasures that to verse belong,
And doubly sweet a brotherhood in song;
Nor can remembrance, Mathew! bring to view
A fate more pleasing, a delight more true
Than that in which the brother Poets joy'd,
Who with combined powers, their wit employ'd
To raise a trophy to the drama's muses.
The thought of this great partnership diffuses
Over the genius loving heart, a feeling
Of all that's high, and great, and good, and healing.

Too partial friend! fain would I follow thee
Past each horizon of fine poesy;
Fain would I echo back each pleasant note
As o'er Sicilian seas, clear anthems float
'Mong the light skimming gondolas far parted,
Just when the sun his farewell beam has darted:
But 'tis impossible; far different cares
Beckon me sternly from soft "Lydian airs,"
And hold my faculties so long in thrall,
That I am oft in doubt whether at all
I shall again see Phoebus in the morning:
Or flush'd Aurora in the roseate dawning!
Or a white Naiad in a rippling stream;
Or a rapt seraph in a moonlight beam;
Or again witness what with thee I've seen,
The dew by fairy feet swept from the green,
After a night of some quaint jubilee
Which every elf and fay had come to see:
When bright processions took their airy march
Beneath the curved moon's triumphal arch.

But might I now each passing moment give
To the coy muse, with me she would not live
In this dark city, nor would condescend
'Mid contradictions her delights to lend.
Should e'er the fine-eyed maid to me be kind,
Ah! surely it must be whene'er I find
Some flowery spot, sequester'd, wild, romantic,
That often must have seen a poet frantic;
Where oaks, that erst the Druid knew, are growing,
And flowers, the glory of one day, are blowing;
Where the dark-leav'd laburnum's drooping clusters
Reflect athwart the stream their yellow lustres,
And intertwined the cassia's arms unite,
With its own drooping buds, but very white.
Where on one side are covert branches hung,
'Mong which the nightingales have always sung
In leafy quiet; where to pry, aloof,
Atween the pillars of the sylvan roof,
Would be to find where violet beds were nestling,
And where the bee with cowslip bells was wrestling.
There must be too a ruin dark, and gloomy,
To say "joy not too much in all that's bloomy."

Yet this is vain—O Mathew lend thy aid
To find a place where I may greet the maid—
Where we may soft humanity put on,
And sit, and rhyme and think on Chatterton;
And that warm-hearted Shakspeare sent to meet him
Four laurell'd spirits, heaven-ward to intreat him.
With reverence would we speak of all the sages
Who have left streaks of light athwart their ages:
And thou shouldst moralize on Milton's blindness,
And mourn the fearful dearth of human kindness
To those who strove with the bright golden wing
Of genius, to flap away each sting
Thrown by the pitiless world. We next could tell
Of those who in the cause of freedom fell:
Of our own Alfred, of Helvetian Tell;
Of him whose name to ev'ry heart's a solace,
High-minded and unbending William Wallace.
While to the rugged north our musing turns
We well might drop a tear for him, and Burns.

Felton! without incitements such as these,
How vain for me the niggard Muse to tease:
For thee, she will thy every dwelling grace,
And make "a sun-shine in a shady place:"
For thou wast once a flowret blooming wild,
Close to the source, bright, pure, and undefil'd,
Whence gush the streams of song: in happy hour
Came chaste Diana from her shady bower,
Just as the sun was from the east uprising;
And, as for him some gift she was devising,
Beheld thee, pluck'd thee, cast thee in the stream
To meet her glorious brother's greeting beam.
I marvel much that thou hast never told
How, from a flower, into a fish of gold
Apollo chang'd thee; how thou next didst seem
A black-eyed swan upon the widening stream;
And when thou first didst in that mirror trace
The placid features of a human face:
That thou hast never told thy travels strange.
And all the wonders of the mazy range
O'er pebbly crystal, and o'er golden sands;
Kissing thy daily food from Naiad's pearly hands.

November, 1815.




TO

MY BROTHER GEORGE.

Full many a dreary hour have I past,
My brain bewilder'd, and my mind o'ercast
With heaviness; in seasons when I've thought
No spherey strains by me could e'er be caught
From the blue dome, though I to dimness gaze
On the far depth where sheeted lightning plays;
Or, on the wavy grass outstretch'd supinely,
Pry 'mong the stars, to strive to think divinely:
That I should never hear Apollo's song,
Though feathery clouds were floating all along
The purple west, and, two bright streaks between,
The golden lyre itself were dimly seen:
That the still murmur of the honey bee
Would never teach a rural song to me:
That the bright glance from beauty's eyelids slanting
Would never make a lay of mine enchanting,
Or warm my breast with ardour to unfold
Some tale of love and arms in time of old.

But there are times, when those that love the bay,
Fly from all sorrowing far, far away;
A sudden glow comes on them, nought they see
In water, earth, or air, but poesy.
It has been said, dear George, and true I hold it,
(For knightly Spenser to Libertas told it,)
That when a Poet is in such a trance,
In air he sees white coursers paw, and prance,
Bestridden of gay knights, in gay apparel,
Who at each other tilt in playful quarrel,
And what we, ignorantly, sheet-lightning call,
Is the swift opening of their wide portal,
When the bright warder blows his trumpet clear,
Whose tones reach nought on earth but Poet's ear.
When these enchanted portals open wide,
And through the light the horsemen swiftly glide,
The Poet's eye can reach those golden halls,
And view the glory of their festivals:
Their ladies fair, that in the distance seem
Fit for the silv'ring of a seraph's dream;
Their rich brimm'd goblets, that incessant run
Like the bright spots that move about the sun;
And, when upheld, the wine from each bright jar
Pours with the lustre of a falling star.
Yet further off, are dimly seen their bowers,
Of which, no mortal eye can reach the flowers;
And 'tis right just, for well Apollo knows
'Twould make the Poet quarrel with the rose.
All that's reveal'd from that far seat of blisses,
Is, the clear fountains' interchanging kisses.
As gracefully descending, light and thin,
Like silver streaks across a dolphin's fin,
When he upswimmeth from the coral caves.
And sports with half his tail above the waves.

These wonders strange be sees, and many more,
Whose head is pregnant with poetic lore.
Should he upon an evening ramble fare
With forehead to the soothing breezes bare,
Would he naught see but the dark, silent blue
With all its diamonds trembling through and through:
Or the coy moon, when in the waviness
Of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress,
And staidly paces higher up, and higher,
Like a sweet nun in holy-day attire?
Ah, yes! much more would start into his sight—
The revelries, and mysteries of night:
And should I ever see them, I will tell you
Such tales as needs must with amazement spell you.

These are the living pleasures of the bard:
But richer far posterity's award.
What does he murmur with his latest breath,
While his proud eye looks through the film of death?
"What though I leave this dull, and earthly mould,
Yet shall my spirit lofty converse hold
With after times.—The patriot shall feel
My stern alarum, and unsheath his steel;
Or, in the senate thunder out my numbers
To startle princes from their easy slumbers.
The sage will mingle with each moral theme
My happy thoughts sententious; he will teem
With lofty periods when my verses fire him,
And then I'll stoop from heaven to inspire him.
Lays have I left of such a dear delight
That maids will sing them on their bridal night.
Gay villagers, upon a morn of May
When they have tired their gentle limbs, with play,
And form'd a snowy circle on the grass,
And plac'd in midst of all that lovely lass
Who chosen is their queen,—with her fine head
Crowned with flowers purple, white, and red:
For there the lily, and the musk-rose, sighing,
Are emblems true of hapless lovers dying:
Between her breasts, that never yet felt trouble,
A bunch of violets full blown, and double,
Serenely sleep:—she from a casket takes
A little book,—and then a joy awakes
About each youthful heart,—with stifled cries,
And rubbing of white hands, and sparkling eyes:
For she's to read a tale of hopes, and fears;
One that I foster'd in my youthful years:
The pearls, that on each glist'ning circlet sleep,
Gush ever and anon with silent creep,
Lured by the innocent dimples. To sweet rest
Shall the dear babe, upon its mother's breast,
Be lull'd with songs of mine. Fair world, adieu!
Thy dales, and hills, are fading from my view:
Swiftly I mount, upon wide spreading pinions,
Far from the narrow bounds of thy dominions.
Full joy I feel, while thus I cleave the air,
That my soft verse will charm thy daughters fair,
And warm thy sons!" Ah, my dear friend and brother,
Could I, at once, my mad ambition smother,
For tasting joys like these, sure I should be
Happier, and dearer to society.
At times, 'tis true, I've felt relief from pain
When some bright thought has darted through my brain:
Through all that day I've felt a greater pleasure
Than if I'd brought to light a hidden treasure.
As to my sonnets, though none else should heed them,
I feel delighted, still, that you should read them.
Of late, too, I have had much calm enjoyment,
Stretch'd on the grass at my best lov'd employment
Of scribbling lines for you. These things I thought
While, in my face, the freshest breeze I caught.
E'en now I'm pillow'd on a bed of flowers
That crowns a lofty clift, which proudly towers
Above the ocean-waves. The stalks, and blades,
Chequer my tablet with their, quivering shades.
On one side is a field of drooping oats,
Through which the poppies show their scarlet coats
So pert and useless, that they bring to mind
The scarlet coats that pester human-kind.
And on the other side, outspread, is seen
Ocean's blue mantle streak'd with purple, and green.
Now 'tis I see a canvass'd ship, and now
Mark the bright silver curling round her prow.
I see the lark down-dropping to his nest.
And the broad winged sea-gull never at rest;
For when no more he spreads his feathers free,
His breast is dancing on the restless sea.
Now I direct my eyes into the west,
Which at this moment is in sunbeams drest:
Why westward turn? 'Twas but to say adieu!
'Twas but to kiss my hand, dear George, to you!

August, 1816.



TO

CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.

Oft have you seen a swan superbly frowning,
And with proud breast his own white shadow crowning;
He slants his neck beneath the waters bright
So silently, it seems a beam of light
Come from the galaxy: anon he sports,—
With outspread wings the Naiad Zephyr courts,
Or ruffles all the surface of the lake
In striving from its crystal face to take
Some diamond water drops, and them to treasure
In milky nest, and sip them off at leisure.
But not a moment can he there insure them,
Nor to such downy rest can he allure them;
For down they rush as though they would be free,
And drop like hours into eternity.
Just like that bird am I in loss of time,
Whene'er I venture on the stream of rhyme;
With shatter'd boat, oar snapt, and canvass rent,
I slowly sail, scarce knowing my intent;
Still scooping up the water with my fingers,
In which a trembling diamond never lingers.

By this, friend Charles, you may full plainly see
Why I have never penn'd a line to thee:
Because my thoughts were never free, and clear,
And little fit to please a classic ear;
Because my wine was of too poor a savour
For one whose palate gladdens in the flavour
Of sparkling Helicon:—small good it were
To take him to a desert rude, and bare.
Who had on Baiae's shore reclin'd at ease,
While Tasso's page was floating in a breeze
That gave soft music from Armida's bowers,
Mingled with fragrance from her rarest flowers:
Small good to one who had by Mulla's stream
Fondled the maidens with the breasts of cream;
Who had beheld Belphoebe in a brook,
And lovely Una in a leafy nook,
And Archimago leaning o'er his book:
Who had of all that's sweet tasted, and seen,
From silv'ry ripple, up to beauty's queen;
From the sequester'd haunts of gay Titania,
To the blue dwelling of divine Urania:
One, who, of late, had ta'en sweet forest walks
With him who elegantly chats, and talks—
The wrong'd Libert as,—who has told you stories
Of laurel chaplets, and Apollo's glories;
Of troops chivalrous prancing; through a city,
And tearful ladies made for love, and pity:
With many else which I have never known.
Thus have I thought; and days on days have flown
Slowly, or rapidly—unwilling still
For you to try my dull, unlearned quill.
Nor should I now, but that I've known you long;
That you first taught me all the sweets of song:
The grand, the sweet, the terse, the free, the fine;
What swell'd with pathos, and what right divine:
Spenserian vowels that elope with ease,
And float along like birds o'er summer seas;
Miltonian storms, and more, Miltonian tenderness;
Michael in arms, and more, meek Eve's fair slenderness.
Who read for me the sonnet swelling loudly
Up to its climax and then dying proudly?
Who found for me the grandeur of the ode,
Growing, like Atlas, stronger from its load?
Who let me taste that more than cordial dram,
The sharp, the rapier-pointed epigram?
Shew'd me that epic was of all the king,
Round, vast, and spanning all like Saturn's ring?
You too upheld the veil from Clio's beauty,
And pointed out the patriot's stern duty;
The might of Alfred, and the shaft of Tell;
The hand of Brutus, that so grandly fell
Upon a tyrant's head. Ah! had I never seen,
Or known your kindness, what might I have been?
What my enjoyments in my youthful years,
Bereft of all that now my life endears?
And can I e'er these benefits forget?
And can I e'er repay the friendly debt?
No, doubly no;—yet should these rhymings please,
I shall roll on the grass with two-fold ease:
For I have long time been my fancy feeding
With hopes that you would one day think the reading
Of my rough verses not an hour misspent;
Should it e'er be so, what a rich content!
Some weeks have pass'd since last I saw the spires
In lucent Thames reflected:—warm desires
To see the sun o'er peep the eastern dimness,
And morning shadows streaking into slimness
Across the lawny fields, and pebbly water;
To mark the time as they grow broad, and shorter;
To feel the air that plays about the hills,
And sips its freshness from the little rills;
To see high, golden corn wave in the light
When Cynthia smiles upon a summer's night,
And peers among the cloudlet's jet and white,
As though she were reclining in a bed
Of bean blossoms, in heaven freshly shed.
No sooner had I stepp'd into these pleasures
Than I began to think of rhymes and measures:
The air that floated by me seem'd to say
"Write! thou wilt never have a better day."
And so I did. When many lines I'd written,
Though with their grace I was not oversmitten,
Yet, as my hand was warm, I thought I'd better
Trust to my feelings, and write you a letter.
Such an attempt required an inspiration
Of a peculiar sort,—a consummation;—
Which, had I felt, these scribblings might have been
Verses from which the soul would never wean:
But many days have past since last my heart
Was warm'd luxuriously by divine Mozart;
By Arne delighted, or by Handel madden'd;
Or by the song of Erin pierc'd and sadden'd:
What time you were before the music sitting,
And the rich notes to each sensation fitting.
Since I have walk'd with you through shady lanes
That freshly terminate in open plains,
And revel'd in a chat that ceased not
When at night-fall among your books we got:
No, nor when supper came, nor after that,—
Nor when reluctantly I took my hat;
No, nor till cordially you shook my hand
Mid-way between our homes:—your accents bland
Still sounded in my ears, when I no more
Could hear your footsteps touch the grav'ly floor.
Sometimes I lost them, and then found again;
You chang'd the footpath for the grassy plain.
In those still moments I have wish'd you joys
That well you know to honour:—"Life's very toys
With him," said I, "will take a pleasant charm;
It cannot be that ought will work him harm."
These thoughts now come o'er me with all their might:—
Again I shake your hand,—friend Charles, good night.

September, 1816.





SONNETS



I.

TO MY BROTHER GEORGE.

Many the wonders I this day have seen:
  The sun, when first he kist away the tears
  That fill'd the eyes of morn;—the laurel'd peers
Who from the feathery gold of evening lean:—
The ocean with its vastness, its blue green,
  Its ships, its rocks, its caves, its hopes, its fears,—
  Its voice mysterious, which whoso hears
Must think on what will be, and what has been.
E'en now, dear George, while this for you I write,
  Cynthia is from her silken curtains peeping
So scantly, that it seems her bridal night,
  And she her half-discover'd revels keeping.
But what, without the social thought of thee,
Would be the wonders of the sky and sea?




II.

TO  * * * * * *

Had I a man's fair form, then might my sighs
  Be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell,
  Thine ear, and find thy gentle heart; so well
Would passion arm me for the enterprize:
But ah! I am no knight whose foeman dies;
  No cuirass glistens on my bosom's swell;
  I am no happy shepherd of the dell
Whose lips have trembled with a maiden's eyes;
Yet must I dote upon thee,—call thee sweet.
  Sweeter by far than Hybla's honied roses
    When steep'd in dew rich to intoxication.
Ah! I will taste that dew, for me 'tis meet,
  And when the moon her pallid face discloses,
    I'll gather some by spells, and incantation.



III.

Written on the day that Mr. Leigh Hunt left Prison.

What though, for showing truth to flatter'd state
  Kind Hunt was shut in prison, yet has he,
  In his immortal spirit, been as free
As the sky-searching lark, and as elate.
Minion of grandeur! think you he did wait?
  Think you he nought but prison walls did see,
  Till, so unwilling, thou unturn'dst the key?
Ah, no! far happier, nobler was his fate!
In Spenser's halls he strayed, and bowers fair,
  Culling enchanted flowers; and he flew
With daring Milton through the fields of air:
  To regions of his own his genius true
Took happy flights. Who shall his fame impair
  When thou art dead, and all thy wretched crew?



IV.

How many bards gild the lapses of time!
  A few of them have ever been the food
  Of my delighted fancy,—I could brood
Over their beauties, earthly, or sublime:
And often, when I sit me down to rhyme,
  These will in throngs before my mind intrude:
  But no confusion, no disturbance rude
Do they occasion; 'tis a pleasing chime.
So the unnumber'd sounds that evening store;
  The songs of birds—the whisp'ring of the leaves—
The voice of waters—the great bell that heaves
  With solemn sound,—and thousand others more,
That distance of recognizance bereaves,
  Make pleasing music, and not wild uproar.



V.

To a Friend who sent me some Roses.

As late I rambled in the happy fields,
  What time the sky-lark shakes the tremulous dew
  From his lush clover covert;—when anew
Adventurous knights take up their dinted shields:
I saw the sweetest flower wild nature yields,
  A fresh-blown musk-rose; 'twas the first that threw
  Its sweets upon the summer: graceful it grew
As is the wand that queen Titania wields.
And, as I feasted on its fragrancy,
  I thought the garden-rose it far excell'd:
But when, O Wells! thy roses came to me
  My sense with their deliciousness was spell'd:
Soft voices had they, that with tender plea
  Whisper'd of peace, and truth, and friendliness unquell'd.



VI.

To  G. A. W.

Nymph of the downward smile, and sidelong glance,
  In what diviner moments of the day
  Art thou most lovely? When gone far astray
Into the labyrinths of sweet utterance?
Or when serenely wand'ring in a trance
  Of sober thought? Or when starting away,
  With careless robe, to meet the morning ray,
Thou spar'st the flowers in thy mazy dance?
Haply 'tis when thy ruby lips part sweetly,
  And so remain, because thou listenest:
But thou to please wert nurtured so completely
  That I can never tell what mood is best.
I shall as soon pronounce which grace more neatly
  Trips it before Apollo than the rest.



VII.

O Solitude! if I must with thee dwell,
  Let it not be among the jumbled heap
  Of murky buildings; climb with me the steep,—
Nature's observatory—whence the dell,
Its flowery slopes, its river's crystal swell,
  May seem a span; let me thy vigils keep
  'Mongst boughs pavillion'd, where the deer's swift leap
Startles the wild bee from the fox-glove bell.
But though I'll gladly trace these scenes with thee,
  Yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind,
Whose words are images of thoughts refin'd,
  Is my soul's pleasure; and it sure must be
Almost the highest bliss of human-kind,
  When to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee.



VIII.

TO MY BROTHERS.

Small, busy flames play through the fresh laid coals,
  And their faint cracklings o'er our silence creep
  Like whispers of the household gods that keep
A gentle empire o'er fraternal souls.
And while, for rhymes, I search around the poles,
  Your eyes are fix'd, as in poetic sleep,
  Upon the lore so voluble and deep,
That aye at fall of night our care condoles.
This is your birth-day Tom, and I rejoice
  That thus it passes smoothly, quietly.
Many such eves of gently whisp'ring noise
  May we together pass, and calmly try
What are this world's true joys,—ere the great voice,
  From its fair face, shall bid our spirits fly.

November 18, 1816.



IX.

Keen, fitful gusts are whisp'ring here and there
  Among the bushes half leafless, and dry;
  The stars look very cold about the sky,
And I have many miles on foot to fare.
Yet feel I little of the cool bleak air,
  Or of the dead leaves rustling drearily,
  Or of those silver lamps that burn on high,
Or of the distance from home's pleasant lair:
For I am brimfull of the friendliness
  That in a little cottage I have found;
Of fair-hair'd Milton's eloquent distress,
  And all his love for gentle Lycid drown'd;
Of lovely Laura in her light green dress,
  And faithful Petrarch gloriously crown'd.



X.

To one who has been long in city pent,
  'Tis very sweet to look into the fair
  And open face of heaven,—to breathe a prayer
Full in the smile of the blue firmament.
Who is more happy, when, with hearts content,
  Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair
  Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair
And gentle tale of love and languishment?
Returning home at evening, with an ear
  Catching the notes of Philomel,—an eye
Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career,
  He mourns that day so soon has glided by:
E'en like the passage of an angel's tear
  That falls through the clear ether silently.



XI.

On first looking into Chapman's Homer.

Much have I traveled in the realms of gold,
  And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
  Round many western islands have I been
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
  That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne;
  Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
  When a new planet swims into his ken;
Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
  He star'd at the Pacific—and all his men
Look'd at each other with a wild surmise—
  Silent, upon a peak in Darien.



XII.

On leaving some Friends at an early Hour.

Give me a golden pen, and let me lean
  On heap'd up flowers, in regions clear, and far;
  Bring me a tablet whiter than a star,
Or hand of hymning angel, when 'tis seen
The silver strings of heavenly harp atween:
  And let there glide by many a pearly car,
  Pink robes, and wavy hair, and diamond jar,
And half discovered wings, and glances keen.
The while let music wander round my ears.
  And as it reaches each delicious ending,
    Let me write down a line of glorious tone,
And full of many wonders of the spheres:
  For what a height my spirit is contending!
    'Tis not content so soon to be alone.



XIII.

ADDRESSED TO HAYDON.

Highmindedness, a jealousy for good,
  A loving-kindness for the great man's fame,
  Dwells here and there with people of no name,
In noisome alley, and in pathless wood:
And where we think the truth least understood,
  Oft may be found a "singleness of aim,"
  That ought to frighten into hooded shame
A money mong'ring, pitiable brood.
How glorious this affection for the cause
  Of stedfast genius, toiling gallantly!
What when a stout unbending champion awes
  Envy, and Malice to their native sty?
Unnumber'd souls breathe out a still applause,
  Proud to behold him in his country's eye.



XIV.

ADDRESSED TO THE SAME.

Great spirits now on earth are sojourning;
  He of the cloud, the cataract, the lake,
  Who on Helvellyn's summit, wide awake,
Catches his freshness from Archangel's wing:
He of the rose, the violet, the spring.
  The social smile, the chain for Freedom's sake:
  And lo!—whose stedfastness would never take
A meaner sound than Raphael's whispering.
And other spirits there are standing apart
  Upon the forehead of the age to come;
These, these will give the world another heart,
  And other pulses. Hear ye not the hum
Of mighty workings?——————
  Listen awhile ye nations, and be dumb.



XV.

On the Grasshopper and Cricket.

The poetry of earth is never dead:
  When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
  And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;
That is the Grasshopper's—he takes the lead
  In summer luxury,—he has never done
  With his delights; for when tired out with fun
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.
The poetry of earth is ceasing never:
  On a lone winter evening, when the frost
    Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills
The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,
  And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,
    The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.

December 30, 1816.



XVI.

TO KOSCIUSKO.

Good Kosciusko, thy great name alone
  Is a full harvest whence to reap high feeling;
  It comes upon us like the glorious pealing
Of the wide spheres—an everlasting tone.
And now it tells me, that in worlds unknown,
  The names of heroes, burst from clouds concealing,
  And changed to harmonies, for ever stealing
Through cloudless blue, and round each silver throne.
It tells me too, that on a happy day,
  When some good spirit walks upon the earth,
  Thy name with Alfred's, and the great of yore
Gently commingling, gives tremendous birth
To a loud hymn, that sounds far, far away
  To where the great God lives for evermore.



XVII.

Happy is England! I could be content
  To see no other verdure than its own;
  To feel no other breezes than are blown
Through its tall woods with high romances blent:
Yet do I sometimes feel a languishment
  For skies Italian, and an inward groan
  To sit upon an Alp as on a throne,
And half forget what world or worldling meant.
Happy is England, sweet her artless daughters;
  Enough their simple loveliness for me,
    Enough their whitest arms in silence clinging:
  Yet do I often warmly burn to see
    Beauties of deeper glance, and hear their singing,
And float with them about the summer waters.





SLEEP AND POETRY

"As I lay in my bed slepe full unmete
Was unto me, but why that I ne might
Rest I ne wist, for there n'as erthly wight
[As I suppose] had more of hertis ese
Than I, for I n'ad sicknesse nor disese."
CHAUCER.



SLEEP AND POETRY

What is more gentle than a wind in summer?
What is more soothing than the pretty hummer
That stays one moment in an open flower,
And buzzes cheerily from bower to bower?
What is more tranquil than a musk-rose blowing
In a green island, far from all men's knowing?
More healthful than the leafiness of dales?
More secret than a nest of nightingales?
More serene than Cordelia's countenance?
More full of visions than a high romance?
What, but thee Sleep? Soft closer of our eyes!
Low murmurer of tender lullabies!
Light hoverer around our happy pillows!
Wreather of poppy buds, and weeping willows!
Silent entangler of a beauty's tresses!
Most happy listener! when the morning blesses
Thee for enlivening all the cheerful eyes
That glance so brightly at the new sun-rise.

But what is higher beyond thought than thee?
Fresher than berries of a mountain tree?
More strange, more beautiful, more smooth, more regal,
Than wings of swans, than doves, than dim-seen eagle?
What is it? And to what shall I compare it?
It has a glory, and nought else can share it:
The thought thereof is awful, sweet, and holy,
Chacing away all worldliness and folly;
Coming sometimes like fearful claps of thunder,
Or the low rumblings earth's regions under;
And sometimes like a gentle whispering
Of all the secrets of some wond'rous thing
That breathes about us in the vacant air;
So that we look around with prying stare,
Perhaps to see shapes of light, aerial lymning,
And catch soft floatings from a faint-heard hymning;
To see the laurel wreath, on high suspended,
That is to crown our name when life is ended.
Sometimes it gives a glory to the voice,
And from the heart up-springs, rejoice! rejoice!
Sounds which will reach the Framer of all things,
And die away in ardent mutterings.

No one who once the glorious sun has seen,
And all the clouds, and felt his bosom clean
For his great Maker's presence, but must know
What 'tis I mean, and feel his being glow:
Therefore no insult will I give his spirit,
By telling what he sees from native merit.

O Poesy! for thee I hold my pen
That am not yet a glorious denizen
Of thy wide heaven—Should I rather kneel
Upon some mountain-top until I feel
A glowing splendour round about me hung,
And echo back the voice of thine own tongue?
O Poesy! for thee I grasp my pen
That am not yet a glorious denizen
Of thy wide heaven; yet, to my ardent prayer,
Yield from thy sanctuary some clear air,
Smoothed for intoxication by the breath
Of flowering bays, that I may die a death
Of luxury, and my young spirit follow
The morning sun-beams to the great Apollo
Like a fresh sacrifice; or, if I can bear
The o'erwhelming sweets, 'twill bring to me the fair
Visions of all places: a bowery nook
Will be elysium—an eternal book
Whence I may copy many a lovely saying
About the leaves, and flowers—about the playing
Of nymphs in woods, and fountains; and the shade
Keeping a silence round a sleeping maid;
And many a verse from so strange influence
That we must ever wonder how, and whence
It came. Also imaginings will hover
Round my fire-side, and haply there discover
Vistas of solemn beauty, where I'd wander
In happy silence, like the clear meander
Through its lone vales; and where I found a spot
Of awfuller shade, or an enchanted grot,
Or a green hill o'erspread with chequered dress
Of flowers, and fearful from its loveliness,
Write on my tablets all that was permitted,
All that was for our human senses fitted.
Then the events of this wide world I'd seize
Like a strong giant, and my spirit teaze
Till at its shoulders it should proudly see
Wings to find out an immortality.

Stop and consider! life is but a day;
A fragile dew-drop on its perilous way
From a tree's summit; a poor Indian's sleep
While his boat hastens to the monstrous steep
Of Montmorenci. Why so sad a moan?
Life is the rose's hope while yet unblown;
The reading of an ever-changing tale;
The light uplifting of a maiden's veil;
A pigeon tumbling in clear summer air;
A laughing school-boy, without grief or care,
Riding the springy branches of an elm.

O for ten years, that I may overwhelm
Myself in poesy; so I may do the deed
That my own soul has to itself decreed.
Then will I pass the countries that I see
In long perspective, and continually
Taste their pure fountains. First the realm I'll pass
Of Flora, and old Pan: sleep in the grass,
Feed upon apples red, and strawberries,
And choose each pleasure that my fancy sees;
Catch the white-handed nymphs in shady places,
To woo sweet kisses from averted faces,—
Play with their fingers, touch their shoulders white
Into a pretty shrinking with a bite
As hard as lips can make it: till agreed,
A lovely tale of human life we'll read.
And one will teach a tame dove how it best
May fan the cool air gently o'er my rest;
Another, bending o'er her nimble tread,
Will set a green robe floating round her head,
And still will dance with ever varied case,
Smiling upon the flowers and the trees:
Another will entice me on, and on
Through almond blossoms and rich cinnamon;
Till in the bosom of a leafy world
We rest in silence, like two gems upcurl'd
In the recesses of a pearly shell.

And can I ever bid these joys farewell?
Yes, I must pass them for a nobler life,
Where I may find the agonies, the strife
Of human hearts: for lo! I see afar,
O'er sailing the blue cragginess, a car
And steeds with streamy manes—the charioteer
Looks out upon the winds with glorious fear:
And now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly
Along a huge cloud's ridge; and now with sprightly
Wheel downward come they into fresher skies,
Tipt round with silver from the sun's bright eyes.
Still downward with capacious whirl they glide,
And now I see them on a green-hill's side
In breezy rest among the nodding stalks.
The charioteer with wond'rous gesture talks
To the trees and mountains; and there soon appear
Shapes of delight, of mystery, and fear,
Passing along before a dusky space
Made by some mighty oaks: as they would chase
Some ever-fleeting music on they sweep.
Lo! how they murmur, laugh, and smile, and weep:
Some with upholden hand and mouth severe;
Some with their faces muffled to the ear
Between their arms; some, clear in youthful bloom,
Go glad and smilingly, athwart the gloom;
Some looking back, and some with upward gaze;
Yes, thousands in a thousand different ways
Flit onward—now a lovely wreath of girls
Dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls;
And now broad wings. Most awfully intent
The driver, of those steeds is forward bent,
And seems to listen: O that I might know
All that he writes with such a hurrying glow.

The visions all are fled—the car is fled
Into the light of heaven, and in their stead
A sense of real things comes doubly strong,
And, like a muddy stream, would bear along
My soul to nothingness: but I will strive
Against all doublings, and will keep alive
The thought of that same chariot, and the strange
Journey it went.

          Is there so small a range
In the present strength of manhood, that the high
Imagination cannot freely fly
As she was wont of old? prepare her steeds,
Paw up against the light, and do strange deeds
Upon the clouds? Has she not shewn us all?
From the clear space of ether, to the small
Breath of new buds unfolding? From the meaning
Of Jove's large eye-brow, to the tender greening
Of April meadows? Here her altar shone,
E'en in this isle; and who could paragon
The fervid choir that lifted up a noise
Of harmony, to where it aye will poise
Its mighty self of convoluting sound,
Huge as a planet, and like that roll round,
Eternally around a dizzy void?
Ay, in those days the Muses were nigh cloy'd
With honors; nor had any other care
Than to sing out and sooth their wavy hair.

Could all this be forgotten? Yes, a schism
Nurtured by foppery and barbarism,
Made great Apollo blush for this his land.
Men were thought wise who could not understand
His glories: with a puling infant's force
They sway'd about upon a rocking horse,
And thought it Pegasus. Ah dismal soul'd!
The winds of heaven blew, the ocean roll'd
Its gathering waves—ye felt it not. The blue
Bared its eternal bosom, and the dew
Of summer nights collected still to make
The morning precious: beauty was awake!
Why were ye not awake? But ye were dead
To things ye knew not of,—were closely wed
To musty laws lined out with wretched rule
And compass vile: so that ye taught a school
Of dolts to smooth, inlay, and clip, and fit,
Till, like the certain wands of Jacob's wit,
Their verses tallied. Easy was the task:
A thousand handicraftsmen wore the mask
Of Poesy. Ill-fated, impious race!
That blasphemed the bright Lyrist to his face,
And did not know it,—no, they went about,
Holding a poor, decrepid standard out
Mark'd with most flimsy mottos, and in large
The name of one Boileau!

                         O ye whose charge
It is to hover round our pleasant hills!
Whose congregated majesty so fills
My boundly reverence, that I cannot trace
Your hallowed names, in this unholy place,
So near those common folk; did not their shames
Affright you? Did our old lamenting Thames
Delight you? Did ye never cluster round
Delicious Avon, with a mournful sound,
And weep? Or did ye wholly bid adieu
To regions where no more the laurel grew?
Or did ye stay to give a welcoming
To some lone spirits who could proudly sing
Their youth away, and die? 'Twas even so:
But let me think away those times of woe:
Now 'tis a fairer season; ye have breathed
Rich benedictions o'er us; ye have wreathed
Fresh garlands: for sweet music has been heard
In many places;—some has been upstirr'd
From out its crystal dwelling in a lake,
By a swan's ebon bill; from a thick brake,
Nested and quiet in a valley mild,
Bubbles a pipe; fine sounds are floating wild
About the earth: happy are ye and glad.

These things are doubtless: yet in truth we've had
Strange thunders from the potency of song;
Mingled indeed with what is sweet and strong,
From majesty: but in clear truth the themes
Are ugly clubs, the Poets Polyphemes
Disturbing the grand sea. A drainless shower
Of light is poesy; 'tis the supreme of power;
'Tis might half slumb'ring on its own right arm.
The very archings of her eye-lids charm
A thousand willing agents to obey,
And still she governs with the mildest sway:
But strength alone though of the Muses born
Is like a fallen angel: trees uptorn,
Darkness, and worms, and shrouds, and sepulchres
Delight it; for it feeds upon the burrs,
And thorns of life; forgetting the great end
Of poesy, that it should be a friend
To sooth the cares, and lift the thoughts of man.

  Yet I rejoice: a myrtle fairer than
E'er grew in Paphos, from the bitter weeds
Lifts its sweet head into the air, and feeds
A silent space with ever sprouting green.
All tenderest birds there find a pleasant screen,
Creep through the shade with jaunty fluttering,
Nibble the little cupped flowers and sing.
Then let us clear away the choaking thorns
From round its gentle stem; let the young fawns,
Yeaned in after times, when we are flown,
Find a fresh sward beneath it, overgrown
With simple flowers: let there nothing be
More boisterous than a lover's bended knee;
Nought more ungentle than the placid look
Of one who leans upon a closed book;
Nought more untranquil than the grassy slopes
Between two hills. All hail delightful hopes!
As she was wont, th' imagination
Into most lovely labyrinths will be gone,
And they shall be accounted poet kings
Who simply tell the most heart-easing things.
O may these joys be ripe before I die.

Will not some say that I presumptuously
Have spoken? that from hastening disgrace
'Twere better far to hide my foolish face?
That whining boyhood should with reverence bow
Ere the dread thunderbolt could reach? How!
If I do hide myself, it sure shall be
In the very fane, the light of Poesy:
If I do fall, at least I will be laid
Beneath the silence of a poplar shade;
And over me the grass shall be smooth shaven;
And there shall be a kind memorial graven.
But oft' Despondence! miserable bane!
They should not know thee, who athirst to gain
A noble end, are thirsty every hour.
What though I am not wealthy in the dower
Of spanning wisdom; though I do not know
The shiftings of the mighty winds, that blow
Hither and thither all the changing thoughts
Of man: though no great minist'ring reason sorts
Out the dark mysteries of human souls
To clear conceiving: yet there ever rolls
A vast idea before me, and I glean
Therefrom my liberty; thence too I've seen
The end and aim of Poesy. 'Tis clear
As any thing most true; as that the year
Is made of the four seasons—manifest
As a large cross, some old cathedral's crest,
Lifted to the white clouds. Therefore should I
Be but the essence of deformity,
A coward, did my very eye-lids wink
At speaking out what I have dared to think.
Ah! rather let me like a madman run
Over some precipice; let the hot sun
Melt my Dedalian wings, and drive me down
Convuls'd and headlong! Stay! an inward frown
Of conscience bids me be more calm awhile.
An ocean dim, sprinkled with many an isle,
Spreads awfully before me. How much toil!
How many days! what desperate turmoil!
Ere I can have explored its widenesses.
Ah, what a task! upon my bended knees,
I could unsay those—no, impossible!
Impossible!

  For sweet relief I'll dwell
On humbler thoughts, and let this strange assay
Begun in gentleness die so away.
E'en now all tumult from my bosom fades:
I turn full hearted to the friendly aids
That smooth the path of honour; brotherhood,
And friendliness the nurse of mutual good.
The hearty grasp that sends a pleasant sonnet
Into the brain ere one can think upon it;
The silence when some rhymes are coming out;
And when they're come, the very pleasant rout:
The message certain to be done to-morrow.
'Tis perhaps as well that it should be to borrow
Some precious book from out its snug retreat,
To cluster round it when we next shall meet.
Scarce can I scribble on; for lovely airs
Are fluttering round the room like doves in pairs;
Many delights of that glad day recalling,
When first my senses caught their tender falling.
And with these airs come forms of elegance
Stooping their shoulders o'er a horse's prance,
Careless, and grand—fingers soft and round
Parting luxuriant curls;—and the swift bound
Of Bacchus from his chariot, when his eye
Made Ariadne's cheek look blushingly.
Thus I remember all the pleasant flow
Of words at opening a portfolio.

Things such as these are ever harbingers
To trains of peaceful images: the stirs
Of a swan's neck unseen among the rushes:
A linnet starting all about the bushes:
A butterfly, with golden wings broad parted,
Nestling a rose, convuls'd as though it smarted
With over pleasure—many, many more,
Might I indulge at large in all my store
Of luxuries: yet I must not forget
Sleep, quiet with his poppy coronet:
For what there may be worthy in these rhymes
I partly owe to him: and thus, the chimes
Of friendly voices had just given place
To as sweet a silence, when I 'gan retrace
The pleasant day, upon a couch at ease.
It was a poet's house who keeps the keys
Of pleasure's temple. Round about were hung
The glorious features of the bards who sung
In other ages—cold and sacred busts
Smiled at each other. Happy he who trusts
To clear Futurity his darling fame!
Then there were fauns and satyrs taking aim
At swelling apples with a frisky leap
And reaching fingers, 'mid a luscious heap
Of vine leaves. Then there rose to view a fane
Of liny marble, and thereto a train
Of nymphs approaching fairly o'er the sward:
One, loveliest, holding her white band toward
The dazzling sun-rise: two sisters sweet
Bending their graceful figures till they meet
Over the trippings of a little child:
And some are hearing, eagerly, the wild
Thrilling liquidity of dewy piping.
See, in another picture, nymphs are wiping
Cherishingly Diana's timorous limbs;—
A fold of lawny mantle dabbling swims
At the bath's edge, and keeps a gentle motion
With the subsiding crystal: as when ocean
Heaves calmly its broad swelling smoothiness o'er
Its rocky marge, and balances once more
The patient weeds; that now unshent by foam
Feel all about their undulating home.

Sappho's meek head was there half smiling down
At nothing; just as though the earnest frown
Of over thinking had that moment gone
From off her brow, and left her all alone.

Great Alfred's too, with anxious, pitying eyes,
As if he always listened to the sighs
Of the goaded world; and Kosciusko's worn
By horrid suffrance—mightily forlorn.

Petrarch, outstepping from the shady green,
Starts at the sight of Laura; nor can wean
His eyes from her sweet face. Most happy they!
For over them was seen a free display
Of out-spread wings, and from between them shone
The face of Poesy: from off her throne
She overlook'd things that I scarce could tell.
The very sense of where I was might well
Keep Sleep aloof: but more than that there came
Thought after thought to nourish up the flame
Within my breast; so that the morning light
Surprised me even from a sleepless night;
And up I rose refresh'd, and glad, and gay,
Resolving to begin that very day
These lines; and howsoever they be done,
I leave them as a father does his son.



Finis.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

ENDYMION:
A Poetic Romance.

BY JOHN KEATS.

“THE STRETCHED METRE OF AN ANTIQUE SONG.”

LONDON:
PRINTED FOR TAYLOR AND HESSEY,
93, FLEET STREET.
1818.
INSCRIBED TO THE MEMORY OF THOMAS CHATTERTON.
PREFACE.
Knowing within myself the manner in which this Poem has been produced, it is not without a feeling of regret that I make it public.

What manner I mean, will be quite clear to the reader, who must soon perceive great inexperience, immaturity, and every error denoting a feverish attempt, rather than a deed accomplished. The two first books, and indeed the two last, I feel sensible are not of such completion as to warrant their passing the press; nor should they if I thought a year's castigation would do them any good;–it will not: the foundations are too sandy. It is just that this youngster should die away: a sad thought for me, if I had not some hope that while it is dwindling I may be plotting, and fitting myself for verses fit to live.

This may be speaking too presumptuously, and may deserve a punishment: but no feeling man will be forward to inflict it: he will leave me alone, with the conviction that there is not a fiercer hell than the failure in a great object. This is not written with the least atom of purpose to forestall criticisms of course, but from the desire I have to conciliate men who are competent to look, and who do look with a zealous eye, to the honour of English literature.
The imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature imagination of a man is healthy; but there is a space of life between, in which the soul is in a ferment, the character undecided, the way of life uncertain, the ambition thick-sighted: thence proceeds mawkishness, and all the thousand bitters which those men I speak of must necessarily taste in going over the following pages.

I hope I have not in too late a day touched the beautiful mythology of Greece, and dulled its brightness: for I wish to try once more, before I bid it farewel.

BOOK I.

A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways10
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
With the green world they live in; and clear rills
That for themselves a cooling covert make
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms20
We have imagined for the mighty dead;
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
An endless fountain of immortal drink,
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
Nor do we merely feel these essences
For one short hour; no, even as the trees
That whisper round a temple become soon
Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,
The passion poesy, glories infinite,
Haunt us till they become a cheering light30
Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,
That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast,
They alway must be with us, or we die.
Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I
Will trace the story of Endymion.
The very music of the name has gone
Into my being, and each pleasant scene
Is growing fresh before me as the green
Of our own vallies: so I will begin
Now while I cannot hear the city's din;40
Now while the early budders are just new,
And run in mazes of the youngest hue
About old forests; while the willow trails
Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails
Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year
Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer
My little boat, for many quiet hours,
With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.
Many and many a verse I hope to write,
Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,50
Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees
Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,
I must be near the middle of my story.
O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,
See it half finished: but let Autumn bold,
With universal tinge of sober gold,
Be all about me when I make an end.
And now at once, adventuresome, I send
My herald thought into a wilderness:
There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress60
My uncertain path with green, that I may speed
Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.
Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread
A mighty forest; for the moist earth fed
So plenteously all weed-hidden roots
Into o'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits.
And it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,
Where no man went; and if from shepherd's keep
A lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,
Never again saw he the happy pens70
Whither his brethren, bleating with content,
Over the hills at every nightfall went.
Among the shepherds, 'twas believed ever,
That not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever
From the white flock, but pass'd unworried
By angry wolf, or pard with prying head,
Until it came to some unfooted plains
Where fed the herds of Pan: ay great his gains
Who thus one lamb did lose. Paths there were many,
Winding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,80
And ivy banks; all leading pleasantly
To a wide lawn, whence one could only see
Stems thronging all around between the swell
Of turf and slanting branches: who could tell
The freshness of the space of heaven above,
Edg'd round with dark tree tops? through which a dove
Would often beat its wings, and often too
A little cloud would move across the blue.
Full in the middle of this pleasantness
There stood a marble altar, with a tress90
Of flowers budded newly; and the dew
Had taken fairy phantasies to strew
Daisies upon the sacred sward last eve,
And so the dawned light in pomp receive.
For 'twas the morn: Apollo's upward fire
Made every eastern cloud a silvery pyre
Of brightness so unsullied, that therein
A melancholy spirit well might win
Oblivion, and melt out his essence fine
Into the winds: rain-scented eglantine100
Gave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;
The lark was lost in him; cold springs had run
To warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;
Man's voice was on the mountains; and the mass
Of nature's lives and wonders puls'd tenfold,
To feel this sun-rise and its glories old.
Now while the silent workings of the dawn
Were busiest, into that self-same lawn
All suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped
A troop of little children garlanded;110
Who gathering round the altar, seemed to pry
Earnestly round as wishing to espy
Some folk of holiday: nor had they waited
For many moments, ere their ears were sated
With a faint breath of music, which ev'n then
Fill'd out its voice, and died away again.
Within a little space again it gave
Its airy swellings, with a gentle wave,
To light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking
Through copse-clad vallies,–ere their death, o'ertaking
The surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.121
And now, as deep into the wood as we
Might mark a lynx's eye, there glimmered light
Fair faces and a rush of garments white,
Plainer and plainer shewing, till at last
Into the widest alley they all past,
Making directly for the woodland altar.
O kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter
In telling of this goodly company,
Of their old piety, and of their glee:130
But let a portion of ethereal dew
Fall on my head, and presently unmew
My soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,
To stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.
Leading the way, young damsels danced along,
Bearing the burden of a shepherd song;
Each having a white wicker over brimm'd
With April's tender younglings: next, well trimm'd,
A crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks
As may be read of in Arcadian books;140
Such as sat listening round Apollo's pipe,
When the great deity, for earth too ripe,
Let his divinity o'er-flowing die
In music, through the vales of Thessaly:
Some idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,
And some kept up a shrilly mellow sound
With ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,
Now coming from beneath the forest trees,
A venerable priest full soberly,
Begirt with ministring looks: alway his eye150
Stedfast upon the matted turf he kept,
And after him his sacred vestments swept.
From his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,
Of mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;
And in his left he held a basket full
Of all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:
Wild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still
Than Leda's love, and cresses from the rill.
His aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,
Seem'd like a poll of ivy in the teeth160
Of winter hoar. Then came another crowd
Of shepherds, lifting in due time aloud
Their share of the ditty. After them appear'd,
Up-followed by a multitude that rear'd
Their voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,
Easily rolling so as scarce to mar
The freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:
Who stood therein did seem of great renown
Among the throng. His youth was fully blown,
Shewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;170
And, for those simple times, his garments were
A chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare,
Was hung a silver bugle, and between
His nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.
A smile was on his countenance; he seem'd,
To common lookers on, like one who dream'd
Of idleness in groves Elysian:
But there were some who feelingly could scan
A lurking trouble in his nether lip,
And see that oftentimes the reins would slip180
Through his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,
And think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,
Of logs piled solemnly.–Ah, well-a-day,
Why should our young Endymion pine away!
Soon the assembly, in a circle rang'd,
Stood silent round the shrine: each look was chang'd
To sudden veneration: women meek
Beckon'd their sons to silence; while each cheek
Of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.
Endymion too, without a forest peer,190
Stood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,
Among his brothers of the mountain chase.
In midst of all, the venerable priest
Eyed them with joy from greatest to the least,
And, after lifting up his aged hands,
Thus spake he: "Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!
Whose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:
Whether descended from beneath the rocks
That overtop your mountains; whether come
From vallies where the pipe is never dumb;200
Or from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs
Blue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze
Buds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge
Nibble their fill at ocean's very marge,
Whose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds forlorn
By the dim echoes of old Triton's horn:
Mothers and wives! who day by day prepare
The scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;
And all ye gentle girls who foster up
Udderless lambs, and in a little cup210
Will put choice honey for a favoured youth:
Yea, every one attend! for in good truth
Our vows are wanting to our great god Pan.
Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than
Night-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains
Speckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains
Green'd over April's lap? No howling sad
Sickens our fearful ewes; and we have had
Great bounty from Endymion our lord.
The earth is glad: the merry lark has pour'd220
His early song against yon breezy sky,
That spreads so clear o'er our solemnity."
Thus ending, on the shrine he heap'd a spire
Of teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;
Anon he stain'd the thick and spongy sod
With wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.
Now while the earth was drinking it, and while
Bay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,
And gummy frankincense was sparkling bright
'Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light230
Spread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:
"O thou, whose mighty palace roof doth hang
From jagged trunks, and overshadoweth
Eternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death
Of unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;
Who lov'st to see the hamadryads dress
Their ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;
And through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken
The dreary melody of bedded reeds–
In desolate places, where dank moisture breeds240
The pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;
Bethinking thee, how melancholy loth
Thou wast to lose fair Syrinx–do thou now,
By thy love's milky brow!
By all the trembling mazes that she ran,
Hear us, great Pan!
"O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles
Passion their voices cooingly 'mong myrtles,
What time thou wanderest at eventide
Through sunny meadows, that outskirt the side250
Of thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom
Broad leaved fig trees even now foredoom
Their ripen'd fruitage; yellow girted bees
Their golden honeycombs; our village leas
Their fairest blossom'd beans and poppied corn;
The chuckling linnet its five young unborn,
To sing for thee; low creeping strawberries
Their summer coolness; pent up butterflies
Their freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year
All its completions–be quickly near,260
By every wind that nods the mountain pine,
O forester divine!
"Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies
For willing service; whether to surprise
The squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;
Or upward ragged precipices flit
To save poor lambkins from the eagle's maw;
Or by mysterious enticement draw
Bewildered shepherds to their path again;
Or to tread breathless round the frothy main,270
And gather up all fancifullest shells
For thee to tumble into Naiads' cells,
And, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;
Or to delight thee with fantastic leaping,
The while they pelt each other on the crown
With silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown–
By all the echoes that about thee ring,
Hear us, O satyr king!
"O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears,
While ever and anon to his shorn peers280
A ram goes bleating: Winder of the horn,
When snouted wild-boars routing tender corn
Anger our huntsman: Breather round our farms,
To keep off mildews, and all weather harms:
Strange ministrant of undescribed sounds,
That come a swooning over hollow grounds,
And wither drearily on barren moors:
Dread opener of the mysterious doors
Leading to universal knowledge–see,
Great son of Dryope,290
The many that are come to pay their vows
With leaves about their brows!
Be still the unimaginable lodge
For solitary thinkings; such as dodge
Conception to the very bourne of heaven,
Then leave the naked brain: be still the leaven,
That spreading in this dull and clodded earth
Gives it a touch ethereal–a new birth:
Be still a symbol of immensity;
A firmament reflected in a sea;300
An element filling the space between;
An unknown–but no more: we humbly screen
With uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,
And giving out a shout most heaven rending,
Conjure thee to receive our humble Pæan,
Upon thy Mount Lycean!
Even while they brought the burden to a close,
A shout from the whole multitude arose,
That lingered in the air like dying rolls
Of abrupt thunder, when Ionian shoals310
Of dolphins bob their noses through the brine.
Meantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,
Young companies nimbly began dancing
To the swift treble pipe, and humming string.
Aye, those fair living forms swam heavenly
To tunes forgotten–out of memory:
Fair creatures! whose young childrens' children bred
Thermopylæ its heroes–not yet dead,
But in old marbles ever beautiful.
High genitors, unconscious did they cull320
Time's sweet first-fruits–they danc'd to weariness,
And then in quiet circles did they press
The hillock turf, and caught the latter end
Of some strange history, potent to send
A young mind from its bodily tenement.
Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent
On either side; pitying the sad death
Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath
Of Zephyr slew him,–Zephyr penitent,
Who now, ere Phœbus mounts the firmament,330
Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.
The archers too, upon a wider plain,
Beside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,
And the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft
Branch down sweeping from a tall ash top,
Call'd up a thousand thoughts to envelope
Those who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee
And frantic gape of lonely Niobe,
Poor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young
Were dead and gone, and her caressing tongue340
Lay a lost thing upon her paly lip,
And very, very deadliness did nip
Her motherly cheeks. Arous'd from this sad mood
By one, who at a distance loud halloo'd,
Uplifting his strong bow into the air,
Many might after brighter visions stare:
After the Argonauts, in blind amaze
Tossing about on Neptune's restless ways,
Until, from the horizon's vaulted side,
There shot a golden splendour far and wide,350
Spangling those million poutings of the brine
With quivering ore: 'twas even an awful shine
From the exaltation of Apollo's bow;
A heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.
Who thus were ripe for high contemplating,
Might turn their steps towards the sober ring
Where sat Endymion and the aged priest
'Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas'd
The silvery setting of their mortal star.
There they discours'd upon the fragile bar360
That keeps us from our homes ethereal;
And what our duties there: to nightly call
Vesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;
To summon all the downiest clouds together
For the sun's purple couch; to emulate
In ministring the potent rule of fate
With speed of fire-tailed exhalations;
To tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons
Sweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,
A world of other unguess'd offices.370
Anon they wander'd, by divine converse,
Into Elysium; vieing to rehearse
Each one his own anticipated bliss.
One felt heart-certain that he could not miss
His quick gone love, among fair blossom'd boughs,
Where every zephyr-sigh pouts, and endows
Her lips with music for the welcoming.
Another wish'd, mid that eternal spring,
To meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,
Sweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:380
Who, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,
And with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;
And, ever after, through those regions be
His messenger, his little Mercury,
Some were athirst in soul to see again
Their fellow huntsmen o'er the wide champaign
In times long past; to sit with them, and talk
Of all the chances in their earthly walk;
Comparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores
Of happiness, to when upon the moors,390
Benighted, close they huddled from the cold,
And shar'd their famish'd scrips. Thus all out-told
Their fond imaginations,–saving him
Whose eyelids curtain'd up their jewels dim,
Endymion: yet hourly had he striven
To hide the cankering venom, that had riven
His fainting recollections. Now indeed
His senses had swoon'd off: he did not heed
The sudden silence, or the whispers low,
Or the old eyes dissolving at his woe,400
Or anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,
Or maiden's sigh, that grief itself embalms:
But in the self-same fixed trance he kept,
Like one who on the earth had never slept.
Aye, even as dead-still as a marble man,
Frozen in that old tale Arabian.
Who whispers him so pantingly and close?
Peona, his sweet sister: of all those,
His friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,
And breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade410
A yielding up, a cradling on her care.
Her eloquence did breathe away the curse:
She led him, like some midnight spirit nurse
Of happy changes in emphatic dreams,
Along a path between two little streams,–
Guarding his forehead, with her round elbow,
From low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow
From stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;
Until they came to where these streamlets fall,
With mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,420
Into a river, clear, brimful, and flush
With crystal mocking of the trees and sky.
A little shallop, floating there hard by,
Pointed its beak over the fringed bank;
And soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,
And dipt again, with the young couple's weight,–
Peona guiding, through the water straight,
Towards a bowery island opposite;
Which gaining presently, she steered light
Into a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,430
Where nested was an arbour, overwove
By many a summer's silent fingering;
To whose cool bosom she was used to bring
Her playmates, with their needle broidery,
And minstrel memories of times gone by.
So she was gently glad to see him laid
Under her favourite bower's quiet shade,
On her own couch, new made of flower leaves,
Dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves
When last the sun his autumn tresses shook,440
And the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took.
Soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:
But, ere it crept upon him, he had prest
Peona's busy hand against his lips,
And still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips
In tender pressure. And as a willow keeps
A patient watch over the stream that creeps
Windingly by it, so the quiet maid
Held her in peace: so that a whispering blade
Of grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling450
Down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling
Among sere leaves and twigs, might all be heard.
O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,
That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind
Till it is hush'd and smooth! O unconfin'd
Restraint! imprisoned liberty! great key
To golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,
Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,
Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves
And moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world460
Of silvery enchantment!–who, upfurl'd
Beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,
But renovates and lives?–Thus, in the bower,
Endymion was calm'd to life again.
Opening his eyelids with a healthier brain,
He said: "I feel this thine endearing love
All through my bosom: thou art as a dove
Trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings
About me; and the pearliest dew not brings
Such morning incense from the fields of May,470
As do those brighter drops that twinkling stray
From those kind eyes,–the very home and haunt
Of sisterly affection. Can I want
Aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?
Yet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears
That, any longer, I will pass my days
Alone and sad. No, I will once more raise
My voice upon the mountain-heights; once more
Make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:
Again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll480
Around the breathed boar: again I'll poll
The fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:
And, when the pleasant sun is getting low,
Again I'll linger in a sloping mead
To hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed
Our idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,
And, if thy lute is here, softly intreat
My soul to keep in its resolved course."
Hereat Peona, in their silver source,
Shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,490
And took a lute, from which there pulsing came
A lively prelude, fashioning the way
In which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay
More subtle cadenced, more forest wild
Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child;
And nothing since has floated in the air
So mournful strange. Surely some influence rare
Went, spiritual, through the damsel's hand;
For still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann'd
The quick invisible strings, even though she saw500
Endymion's spirit melt away and thaw
Before the deep intoxication.
But soon she came, with sudden burst, upon
Her self-possession–swung the lute aside,
And earnestly said: "Brother, 'tis vain to hide
That thou dost know of things mysterious,
Immortal, starry; such alone could thus
Weigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn'd in aught
Offensive to the heavenly powers? Caught
A Paphian dove upon a message sent?510
Thy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,
Sacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen
Her naked limbs among the alders green;
And that, alas! is death. No, I can trace
Something more high perplexing in thy face!"
Endymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,
And said, "Art thou so pale, who wast so bland
And merry in our meadows? How is this?
Tell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!–
Ah! thou hast been unhappy at the change520
Wrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?
Or more complete to overwhelm surmise?
Ambition is no sluggard: 'tis no prize,
That toiling years would put within my grasp,
That I have sigh'd for: with so deadly gasp
No man e'er panted for a mortal love.
So all have set my heavier grief above
These things which happen. Rightly have they done:
I, who still saw the horizontal sun
Heave his broad shoulder o'er the edge of the world,530
Out-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl'd
My spear aloft, as signal for the chace–
I, who, for very sport of heart, would race
With my own steed from Araby; pluck down
A vulture from his towery perching; frown
A lion into growling, loth retire–
To lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,
And sink thus low! but I will ease my breast
Of secret grief, here in this bowery nest.
"This river does not see the naked sky,540
Till it begins to progress silverly
Around the western border of the wood,
Whence, from a certain spot, its winding flood
Seems at the distance like a crescent moon:
And in that nook, the very pride of June,
Had I been used to pass my weary eves;
The rather for the sun unwilling leaves
So dear a picture of his sovereign power,
And I could witness his most kingly hour,
When he doth lighten up the golden reins,550
And paces leisurely down amber plains
His snorting four. Now when his chariot last
Its beams against the zodiac-lion cast,
There blossom'd suddenly a magic bed
Of sacred ditamy, and poppies red:
At which I wondered greatly, knowing well
That but one night had wrought this flowery spell;
And, sitting down close by, began to muse
What it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,
In passing here, his owlet pinions shook;560
Or, it may be, ere matron Night uptook
Her ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,
Had dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth
Came not by common growth. Thus on I thought,
Until my head was dizzy and distraught.
Moreover, through the dancing poppies stole
A breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;
And shaping visions all about my sight
Of colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;
The which became more strange, and strange, and dim,
And then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim:571
And then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell
The enchantment that afterwards befel?
Yet it was but a dream: yet such a dream
That never tongue, although it overteem
With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,
Could figure out and to conception bring
All I beheld and felt. Methought I lay
Watching the zenith, where the milky way
Among the stars in virgin splendour pours;580
And travelling my eye, until the doors
Of heaven appear'd to open for my flight,
I became loth and fearful to alight
From such high soaring by a downward glance:
So kept me stedfast in that airy trance,
Spreading imaginary pinions wide.
When, presently, the stars began to glide,
And faint away, before my eager view:
At which I sigh'd that I could not pursue,
And dropt my vision to the horizon's verge;590
And lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge
The loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er
A shell for Neptune's goblet: she did soar
So passionately bright, my dazzled soul
Commingling with her argent spheres did roll
Through clear and cloudy, even when she went
At last into a dark and vapoury tent–
Whereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train
Of planets all were in the blue again.
To commune with those orbs, once more I rais'd600
My sight right upward: but it was quite dazed
By a bright something, sailing down apace,
Making me quickly veil my eyes and face:
Again I look'd, and, O ye deities,
Who from Olympus watch our destinies!
Whence that completed form of all completeness?
Whence came that high perfection of all sweetness?
Speak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O where
Hast thou a symbol of her golden hair?
Not oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;610
Not–thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun
Such follying before thee–yet she had,
Indeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;
And they were simply gordian'd up and braided,
Leaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,
Her pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;
The which were blended in, I know not how,
With such a paradise of lips and eyes,
Blush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,
That, when I think thereon, my spirit clings620
And plays about its fancy, till the stings
Of human neighbourhood envenom all.
Unto what awful power shall I call?
To what high fane?–Ah! see her hovering feet,
More bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet
Than those of sea-born Venus, when she rose
From out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows
Her scarf into a fluttering pavilion;
'Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million
Of little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,630
Over the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,
Handfuls of daisies."–"Endymion, how strange!
Dream within dream!"–"She took an airy range,
And then, towards me, like a very maid,
Came blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,
And press'd me by the hand: Ah! 'twas too much;
Methought I fainted at the charmed touch,
Yet held my recollection, even as one
Who dives three fathoms where the waters run
Gurgling in beds of coral: for anon,640
I felt upmounted in that region
Where falling stars dart their artillery forth,
And eagles struggle with the buffeting north
That balances the heavy meteor-stone;–
Felt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,
But lapp'd and lull'd along the dangerous sky.
Soon, as it seem'd, we left our journeying high,
And straightway into frightful eddies swoop'd;
Such as ay muster where grey time has scoop'd
Huge dens and caverns in a mountain's side:650
There hollow sounds arous'd me, and I sigh'd
To faint once more by looking on my bliss–
I was distracted; madly did I kiss
The wooing arms which held me, and did give
My eyes at once to death: but 'twas to live,
To take in draughts of life from the gold fount
Of kind and passionate looks; to count, and count
The moments, by some greedy help that seem'd
A second self, that each might be redeem'd
And plunder'd of its load of blessedness.660
Ah, desperate mortal! I ev'n dar'd to press
Her very cheek against my crowned lip,
And, at that moment, felt my body dip
Into a warmer air: a moment more,
Our feet were soft in flowers. There was store
Of newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes
A scent of violets, and blossoming limes,
Loiter'd around us; then of honey cells,
Made delicate from all white-flower bells;
And once, above the edges of our nest,670
An arch face peep'd,–an Oread as I guess'd.
"Why did I dream that sleep o'er-power'd me
In midst of all this heaven? Why not see,
Far off, the shadows of his pinions dark,
And stare them from me? But no, like a spark
That needs must die, although its little beam
Reflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream
Fell into nothing–into stupid sleep.
And so it was, until a gentle creep,
A careful moving caught my waking ears,680
And up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,
My clenched hands;–for lo! the poppies hung
Dew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung
A heavy ditty, and the sullen day
Had chidden herald Hesperus away,
With leaden looks: the solitary breeze
Bluster'd, and slept, and its wild self did teaze
With wayward melancholy; and I thought,
Mark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought
Faint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!–690
Away I wander'd–all the pleasant hues
Of heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades
Were deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades
Were full of pestilent light; our taintless rills
Seem'd sooty, and o'er-spread with upturn'd gills
Of dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown
In frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown
Like spiked aloe. If an innocent bird
Before my heedless footsteps stirr'd, and stirr'd
In little journeys, I beheld in it700
A disguis'd demon, missioned to knit
My soul with under darkness; to entice
My stumblings down some monstrous precipice:
Therefore I eager followed, and did curse
The disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,
Rock'd me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!
These things, with all their comfortings, are given
To my down-sunken hours, and with thee,
Sweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea

Of weary life."		710

Thus ended he, and both
Sat silent: for the maid was very loth
To answer; feeling well that breathed words
Would all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords
Against the enchased crocodile, or leaps
Of grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,
And wonders; struggles to devise some blame;
To put on such a look as would say, Shame
On this poor weakness! but, for all her strife,
She could as soon have crush'd away the life720
From a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,
She said with trembling chance: "Is this the cause?
This all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!
That one who through this middle earth should pass
Most like a sojourning demi-god, and leave
His name upon the harp-string, should achieve
No higher bard than simple maidenhood,
Singing alone, and fearfully,–how the blood
Left his young cheek; and how he used to stray
He knew not where; and how he would say, nay,730
If any said 'twas love: and yet 'twas love;
What could it be but love? How a ring-dove
Let fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;
And how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,
The gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;
And then the ballad of his sad life closes
With sighs, and an alas!–Endymion!
Be rather in the trumpet's mouth,–anon
Among the winds at large–that all may hearken!
Although, before the crystal heavens darken,740
I watch and dote upon the silver lakes
Pictur'd in western cloudiness, that takes
The semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,
Islands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands
With horses prancing o'er them, palaces
And towers of amethyst,–would I so tease
My pleasant days, because I could not mount
Into those regions? The Morphean fount
Of that fine element that visions, dreams,
And fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams750
Into its airy channels with so subtle,
So thin a breathing, not the spider's shuttle,
Circled a million times within the space
Of a swallow's nest-door, could delay a trace,
A tinting of its quality: how light
Must dreams themselves be; seeing they're more slight
Than the mere nothing that engenders them!
Then wherefore sully the entrusted gem
Of high and noble life with thoughts so sick?
Why pierce high-fronted honour to the quick760
For nothing but a dream?" Hereat the youth
Look'd up: a conflicting of shame and ruth
Was in his plaited brow: yet, his eyelids
Widened a little, as when Zephyr bids
A little breeze to creep between the fans
Of careless butterflies: amid his pains
He seem'd to taste a drop of manna-dew,
Full palatable; and a colour grew
Upon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.
"Peona! ever have I long'd to slake770
My thirst for the world's praises: nothing base,
No merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace
The stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar'd–
Though now 'tis tatter'd; leaving my bark bar'd
And sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope
Is of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,
To fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.
Wherein lies happiness? In that which becks
Our ready minds to fellowship divine,
A fellowship with essence; till we shine,780
Full alchemiz'd, and free of space. Behold
The clear religion of heaven! Fold
A rose leaf round thy finger's taperness,
And soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress
Of music's kiss impregnates the free winds,
And with a sympathetic touch unbinds
Eolian magic from their lucid wombs:
Then old songs waken from enclouded tombs;
Old ditties sigh above their father's grave;
Ghosts of melodious prophecyings rave790
Round every spot were trod Apollo's foot;
Bronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,
Where long ago a giant battle was;
And, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass
In every place where infant Orpheus slept.
Feel we these things?–that moment have we stept
Into a sort of oneness, and our state
Is like a floating spirit's. But there are
Richer entanglements, enthralments far
More self-destroying, leading, by degrees,800
To the chief intensity: the crown of these
Is made of love and friendship, and sits high
Upon the forehead of humanity.
All its more ponderous and bulky worth
Is friendship, whence there ever issues forth
A steady splendour; but at the tip-top,
There hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop
Of light, and that is love: its influence,
Thrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,
At which we start and fret; till in the end,810
Melting into its radiance, we blend,
Mingle, and so become a part of it,–
Nor with aught else can our souls interknit
So wingedly: when we combine therewith,
Life's self is nourish'd by its proper pith,
And we are nurtured like a pelican brood.
Aye, so delicious is the unsating food,
That men, who might have tower'd in the van
Of all the congregated world, to fan
And winnow from the coming step of time820
All chaff of custom, wipe away all slime
Left by men-slugs and human serpentry,
Have been content to let occasion die,
Whilst they did sleep in love's elysium.
And, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,
Than speak against this ardent listlessness:
For I have ever thought that it might bless
The world with benefits unknowingly;
As does the nightingale, upperched high,
And cloister'd among cool and bunched leaves–830
She sings but to her love, nor e'er conceives
How tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.
Just so may love, although 'tis understood
The mere commingling of passionate breath,
Produce more than our searching witnesseth:
What I know not: but who, of men, can tell
That flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell
To melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,
The earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,
The meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,840
The seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,
Tones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,
If human souls did never kiss and greet?
"Now, if this earthly love has power to make
Men's being mortal, immortal; to shake
Ambition from their memories, and brim
Their measure of content; what merest whim,
Seems all this poor endeavour after fame,
To one, who keeps within his stedfast aim
A love immortal, an immortal too.850
Look not so wilder'd; for these things are true,
And never can be born of atomies
That buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,
Leaving us fancy-sick. No, no, I'm sure,
My restless spirit never could endure
To brood so long upon one luxury,
Unless it did, though fearfully, espy
A hope beyond the shadow of a dream.
My sayings will the less obscured seem,
When I have told thee how my waking sight860
Has made me scruple whether that same night
Was pass'd in dreaming. Hearken, sweet Peona!
Beyond the matron-temple of Latona,
Which we should see but for these darkening boughs,
Lies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows
Bushes and trees do lean all round athwart,
And meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,
And spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide
Past them, but he must brush on every side.
Some moulder'd steps lead into this cool cell,870
Far as the slabbed margin of a well,
Whose patient level peeps its crystal eye
Right upward, through the bushes, to the sky.
Oft have I brought thee flowers, on their stalks set
Like vestal primroses, but dark velvet
Edges them round, and they have golden pits:
'Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits
In a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,
When all above was faint with mid-day heat.
And there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,880
I'd bubble up the water through a reed;
So reaching back to boy-hood: make me ships
Of moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,
With leaves stuck in them; and the Neptune be
Of their petty ocean. Oftener, heavily,
When love-lorn hours had left me less a child,
I sat contemplating the figures wild
Of o'er-head clouds melting the mirror through.
Upon a day, while thus I watch'd, by flew
A cloudy Cupid, with his bow and quiver;890
So plainly character'd, no breeze would shiver
The happy chance: so happy, I was fain
To follow it upon the open plain,
And, therefore, was just going; when, behold!
A wonder, fair as any I have told–
The same bright face I tasted in my sleep,
Smiling in the clear well. My heart did leap
Through the cool depth.–It moved as if to flee–
I started up, when lo! refreshfully,
There came upon my face, in plenteous showers,900
Dew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,
Wrapping all objects from my smothered sight,
Bathing my spirit in a new delight.
Aye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss
Alone preserved me from the drear abyss
Of death, for the fair form had gone again.
Pleasure is oft a visitant; but pain
Clings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth
On the deer's tender haunches: late, and loth,
'Tis scar'd away by slow returning pleasure.910
How sickening, how dark the dreadful leisure
Of weary days, made deeper exquisite,
By a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!
Like sorrow came upon me, heavier still,
Than when I wander'd from the poppy hill:
And a whole age of lingering moments crept
Sluggishly by, ere more contentment swept
Away at once the deadly yellow spleen.
Yes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;
Once more been tortured with renewed life.920
When last the wintry gusts gave over strife
With the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies
Warm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes
In pity of the shatter'd infant buds,–
That time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,
My hunting cap, because I laugh'd and smil'd,
Chatted with thee, and many days exil'd
All torment from my breast;–'twas even then,
Straying about, yet, coop'd up in the den
Of helpless discontent,–hurling my lance930
From place to place, and following at chance,
At last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,
And, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck
In the middle of a brook,–whose silver ramble
Down twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,
Tracing along, it brought me to a cave,
Whence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave
The nether sides of mossy stones and rock,–
'Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock
Its own sweet grief at parting. Overhead,940
Hung a lush scene of drooping weeds, and spread
Thick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph's home.
"Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam?"
Said I, low voic'd: "Ah, whither! 'Tis the grot
Of Proserpine, when Hell, obscure and hot,
Doth her resign; and where her tender hands
She dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:
Or 'tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,
And babbles thorough silence, till her wits
Are gone in tender madness, and anon,950
Faints into sleep, with many a dying tone
Of sadness. O that she would take my vows,
And breathe them sighingly among the boughs,
To sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,
Daily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,
And weave them dyingly–send honey-whispers
Round every leaf, that all those gentle lispers
May sigh my love unto her pitying!
O charitable echo! hear, and sing
This ditty to her!–tell her"–so I stay'd960
My foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,
Stood stupefied with my own empty folly,
And blushing for the freaks of melancholy.
Salt tears were coming, when I heard my name
Most fondly lipp'd, and then these accents came:
"Endymion! the cave is secreter
Than the isle of Delos. Echo hence shall stir
No sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise
Of thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys
And trembles through my labyrinthine hair."970
At that oppress'd I hurried in.–Ah! where
Are those swift moments? Whither are they fled?
I'll smile no more, Peona; nor will wed
Sorrow the way to death; but patiently
Bear up against it: so farewel, sad sigh;
And come instead demurest meditation,
To occupy me wholly, and to fashion
My pilgrimage for the world's dusky brink.
No more will I count over, link by link,
My chain of grief: no longer strive to find980
A half-forgetfulness in mountain wind
Blustering about my ears: aye, thou shalt see,
Dearest of sisters, what my life shall be;
What a calm round of hours shall make my days.
There is a paly flame of hope that plays
Where'er I look: but yet, I'll say 'tis naught–
And here I bid it die. Have not I caught,
Already, a more healthy countenance?
By this the sun is setting; we may chance
Meet some of our near-dwellers with my car."990
This said, he rose, faint-smiling like a star
Through autumn mists, and took Peona's hand:
They stept into the boat, and launch'd from land.
ENDYMION.
BOOK II.

O sovereign power of love! O grief! O balm!
All records, saving thine, come cool, and calm,
And shadowy, through the mist of passed years:
For others, good or bad, hatred and tears
Have become indolent; but touching thine,
One sigh doth echo, one poor sob doth pine,
One kiss brings honey-dew from buried days.
The woes of Troy, towers smothering o'er their blaze,
Stiff-holden shields, far-piercing spears, keen blades,
Struggling, and blood, and shrieks–all dimly fades10
Into some backward corner of the brain;
Yet, in our very souls, we feel amain
The close of Troilus and Cressid sweet.
Hence, pageant history! hence, gilded cheat!
Swart planet in the universe of deeds!
Wide sea, that one continuous murmur breeds
Along the pebbled shore of memory!
Many old rotten-timber'd boats there be
Upon thy vaporous bosom, magnified
To goodly vessels; many a sail of pride,20
And golden keel'd, is left unlaunch'd and dry.
But wherefore this? What care, though owl did fly
About the great Athenian admiral's mast?
What care, though striding Alexander past
The Indus with his Macedonian numbers?
Though old Ulysses tortured from his slumbers
The glutted Cyclops, what care?–Juliet leaning
Amid her window-flowers,–sighing,–weaning
Tenderly her fancy from its maiden snow,
Doth more avail than these: the silver flow30
Of Hero's tears, the swoon of Imogen,
Fair Pastorella in the bandit's den,
Are things to brood on with more ardency
Than the death-day of empires. Fearfully
Must such conviction come upon his head,
Who, thus far, discontent, has dared to tread,
Without one muse's smile, or kind behest,
The path of love and poesy. But rest,
In chaffing restlessness, is yet more drear
Than to be crush'd, in striving to uprear40
Love's standard on the battlements of song.
So once more days and nights aid me along,

Like legion'd soldiers.

Brain-sick shepherd prince,
What promise hast thou faithful guarded since
The day of sacrifice? Or, have new sorrows
Come with the constant dawn upon thy morrows?
Alas! 'tis his old grief. For many days,
Has he been wandering in uncertain ways:
Through wilderness, and woods of mossed oaks;50
Counting his woe-worn minutes, by the strokes
Of the lone woodcutter; and listening still,
Hour after hour, to each lush-leav'd rill.
Now he is sitting by a shady spring,
And elbow-deep with feverous fingering
Stems the upbursting cold: a wild rose tree
Pavilions him in bloom, and he doth see
A bud which snares his fancy: lo! but now
He plucks it, dips its stalk in the water: how!
It swells, it buds, it flowers beneath his sight;60
And, in the middle, there is softly pight
A golden butterfly; upon whose wings
There must be surely character'd strange things,
For with wide eye he wonders, and smiles oft.
Lightly this little herald flew aloft,
Follow'd by glad Endymion's clasped hands:
Onward it flies. From languor's sullen bands
His limbs are loos'd, and eager, on he hies
Dazzled to trace it in the sunny skies.
It seem'd he flew, the way so easy was;70
And like a new-born spirit did he pass
Through the green evening quiet in the sun,
O'er many a heath, through many a woodland dun,
Through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams
The summer time away. One track unseams
A wooded cleft, and, far away, the blue
Of ocean fades upon him; then, anew,
He sinks adown a solitary glen,
Where there was never sound of mortal men,
Saving, perhaps, some snow-light cadences80
Melting to silence, when upon the breeze
Some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet,
To cheer itself to Delphi. Still his feet
Went swift beneath the merry-winged guide,
Until it reached a splashing fountain's side
That, near a cavern's mouth, for ever pour'd
Unto the temperate air: then high it soar'd,
And, downward, suddenly began to dip,
As if, athirst with so much toil, 'twould sip
The crystal spout-head: so it did, with touch90
Most delicate, as though afraid to smutch
Even with mealy gold the waters clear.
But, at that very touch, to disappear
So fairy-quick, was strange! Bewildered,
Endymion sought around, and shook each bed
Of covert flowers in vain; and then he flung
Himself along the grass. What gentle tongue,
What whisperer disturb'd his gloomy rest?
It was a nymph uprisen to the breast
In the fountain's pebbly margin, and she stood100
'Mong lilies, like the youngest of the brood.
To him her dripping hand she softly kist,
And anxiously began to plait and twist
Her ringlets round her fingers, saying: "Youth!
Too long, alas, hast thou starv'd on the ruth,
The bitterness of love: too long indeed,
Seeing thou art so gentle. Could I weed
Thy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer
All the bright riches of my crystal coffer
To Amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish,110
Golden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,
Vermilion-tail'd, or finn'd with silvery gauze;
Yea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws
A virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands
Tawny and gold, ooz'd slowly from far lands
By my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells,
My charming rod, my potent river spells;
Yes, every thing, even to the pearly cup
Meander gave me,–for I bubbled up
To fainting creatures in a desert wild.120
But woe is me, I am but as a child
To gladden thee; and all I dare to say,
Is, that I pity thee; that on this day
I've been thy guide; that thou must wander far
In other regions, past the scanty bar
To mortal steps, before thou cans't be ta'en
From every wasting sigh, from every pain,
Into the gentle bosom of thy love.
Why it is thus, one knows in heaven above:
But, a poor Naiad, I guess not. Farewel!130
I have a ditty for my hollow cell."
Hereat, she vanished from Endymion's gaze,
Who brooded o'er the water in amaze:
The dashing fount pour'd on, and where its pool
Lay, half asleep, in grass and rushes cool,
Quick waterflies and gnats were sporting still,
And fish were dimpling, as if good nor ill
Had fallen out that hour. The wanderer,
Holding his forehead, to keep off the burr
Of smothering fancies, patiently sat down;140
And, while beneath the evening's sleepy frown
Glow-worms began to trim their starry lamps,
Thus breath'd he to himself: "Whoso encamps
To take a fancied city of delight,
O what a wretch is he! and when 'tis his,
After long toil and travelling, to miss
The kernel of his hopes, how more than vile:
Yet, for him there's refreshment even in toil;
Another city doth he set about,
Free from the smallest pebble-head of doubt150
That he will seize on trickling honey-combs:
Alas, he finds them dry; and then he foams,
And onward to another city speeds.
But this is human life: the war, the deeds,
The disappointment, the anxiety,
Imagination's struggles, far and nigh,
All human; bearing in themselves this good,
That they are still the air, the subtle food,
To make us feel existence, and to shew
How quiet death is. Where soil is men grow,160
Whether to weeds or flowers; but for me,
There is no depth to strike in: I can see
Nought earthly worth my compassing; so stand
Upon a misty, jutting head of land–
Alone? No, no; and by the Orphean lute,
When mad Eurydice is listening to't;
I'd rather stand upon this misty peak,
With not a thing to sigh for, or to seek,
But the soft shadow of my thrice-seen love,
Than be–I care not what. O meekest dove170
Of heaven! O Cynthia, ten-times bright and fair!
From thy blue throne, now filling all the air,
Glance but one little beam of temper'd light
Into my bosom, that the dreadful might
And tyranny of love be somewhat scar'd!
Yet do not so, sweet queen; one torment spar'd,
Would give a pang to jealous misery,
Worse than the torment's self: but rather tie
Large wings upon my shoulders, and point out
My love's far dwelling. Though the playful rout180
Of Cupids shun thee, too divine art thou,
Too keen in beauty, for thy silver prow
Not to have dipp'd in love's most gentle stream.
O be propitious, nor severely deem
My madness impious; for, by all the stars
That tend thy bidding, I do think the bars
That kept my spirit in are burst–that I
Am sailing with thee through the dizzy sky!
How beautiful thou art! The world how deep!
How tremulous-dazzlingly the wheels sweep190
Around their axle! Then these gleaming reins,
How lithe! When this thy chariot attains
Its airy goal, haply some bower veils
Those twilight eyes?–Those eyes!–my spirit fails–
Dear goddess, help! or the wide-gaping air
Will gulph me–help!"–At this with madden'd stare,
And lifted hands, and trembling lips he stood;
Like old Deucalion mountain'd o'er the flood,
Or blind Orion hungry for the morn.
And, but from the deep cavern there was borne200
A voice, he had been froze to senseless stone;
Nor sigh of his, nor plaint, nor passion'd moan
Had more been heard. Thus swell'd it forth: "Descend,
Young mountaineer! descend where alleys bend
Into the sparry hollows of the world!
Oft hast thou seen bolts of the thunder hurl'd
As from thy threshold; day by day hast been
A little lower than the chilly sheen
Of icy pinnacles, and dipp'dst thine arms
Into the deadening ether that still charms210
Their marble being: now, as deep profound
As those are high, descend! He ne'er is crown'd
With immortality, who fears to follow
Where airy voices lead: so through the hollow,
The silent mysteries of earth, descend!"
He heard but the last words, nor could contend
One moment in reflection: for he fled
Into the fearful deep, to hide his head
From the clear moon, the trees, and coming madness.
'Twas far too strange, and wonderful for sadness;
Sharpening, by degrees, his appetite221
To dive into the deepest. Dark, nor light,
The region; nor bright, nor sombre wholly,
But mingled up; a gleaming melancholy;
A dusky empire and its diadems;
One faint eternal eventide of gems.
Aye, millions sparkled on a vein of gold,
Along whose track the prince quick footsteps told,
With all its lines abrupt and angular:
Out-shooting sometimes, like a meteor-star,230
Through a vast antre; then the metal woof,
Like Vulcan's rainbow, with some monstrous roof
Curves hugely: now, far in the deep abyss,
It seems an angry lightning, and doth hiss
Fancy into belief: anon it leads
Through winding passages, where sameness breeds
Vexing conceptions of some sudden change;
Whether to silver grots, or giant range
Of sapphire columns, or fantastic bridge
Athwart a flood of crystal. On a ridge240
Now fareth he, that o'er the vast beneath
Towers like an ocean-cliff, and whence he seeth
A hundred waterfalls, whose voices come
But as the murmuring surge. Chilly and numb
His bosom grew, when first he, far away,
Descried an orbed diamond, set to fray
Old darkness from his throne: 'twas like the sun
Uprisen o'er chaos: and with such a stun
Came the amazement, that, absorb'd in it,
He saw not fiercer wonders–past the wit250
Of any spirit to tell, but one of those
Who, when this planet's sphering time doth close,
Will be its high remembrancers: who they?
The mighty ones who have made eternal day
For Greece and England. While astonishment
With deep-drawn sighs was quieting, he went
Into a marble gallery, passing through
A mimic temple, so complete and true
In sacred custom, that he well nigh fear'd
To search it inwards; whence far off appear'd,260
Through a long pillar'd vista, a fair shrine,
And, just beyond, on light tiptoe divine,
A quiver'd Dian. Stepping awfully,
The youth approach'd; oft turning his veil'd eye
Down sidelong aisles, and into niches old.
And when, more near against the marble cold
He had touch'd his forehead, he began to thread
All courts and passages, where silence dead
Rous'd by his whispering footsteps murmured faint:
And long he travers'd to and fro, to acquaint270
Himself with every mystery, and awe;
Till, weary, he sat down before the maw
Of a wide outlet, fathomless and dim
To wild uncertainty and shadows grim.
There, when new wonders ceas'd to float before,
And thoughts of self came on, how crude and sore
The journey homeward to habitual self!
A mad-pursuing of the fog-born elf,
Whose flitting lantern, through rude nettle-briar,
Cheats us into a swamp, into a fire,280
Into the bosom of a hated thing.
What misery most drowningly doth sing
In lone Endymion's ear, now he has caught
The goal of consciousness? Ah, 'tis the thought,
The deadly feel of solitude: for lo!
He cannot see the heavens, nor the flow
Of rivers, nor hill-flowers running wild
In pink and purple chequer, nor, up-pil'd,
The cloudy rack slow journeying in the west,
Like herded elephants; nor felt, nor prest290
Cool grass, nor tasted the fresh slumberous air;
But far from such companionship to wear
An unknown time, surcharg'd with grief, away,
Was now his lot. And must he patient stay,
Tracing fantastic figures with his spear?
"No!" exclaimed he, "why should I tarry here?"
No! loudly echoed times innumerable.
At which he straightway started, and 'gan tell
His paces back into the temple's chief;
Warming and growing strong in the belief300
Of help from Dian: so that when again
He caught her airy form, thus did he plain,
Moving more near the while. "O Haunter chaste
Of river sides, and woods, and heathy waste,
Where with thy silver bow and arrows keen
Art thou now forested? O woodland Queen,
What smoothest air thy smoother forehead woos?
Where dost thou listen to the wide halloos
Of thy disparted nymphs? Through what dark tree
Glimmers thy crescent? Wheresoe'er it be,310
'Tis in the breath of heaven: thou dost taste
Freedom as none can taste it, nor dost waste
Thy loveliness in dismal elements;
But, finding in our green earth sweet contents,
There livest blissfully. Ah, if to thee
It feels Elysian, how rich to me,
An exil'd mortal, sounds its pleasant name!
Within my breast there lives a choking flame–
O let me cool it among the zephyr-boughs!
A homeward fever parches up my tongue–320
O let me slake it at the running springs!
Upon my car a noisy nothing rings–
O let me once more hear the linnet's note!
Before mine eyes thick films and shadows float–
O let me 'noint them with the heaven's light!
Dost thou now lave thy feet and ankles white?
O think how sweet to me the freshening sluice!
Dost thou now please thy thirst with berry-juice?
O think how this dry palate would rejoice!
If in soft slumber thou dost hear my voice,330
O think how I should love a bed of flowers!–
Young goddess! let me see my native bowers!
Deliver me from this rapacious deep!"
Thus ending loudly, as he would o'erleap
His destiny, alert he stood: but when
Obstinate silence came heavily again,
Feeling about for its old couch of space
And airy cradle, lowly bow'd his face
Desponding, o'er the marble floor's cold thrill.
But 'twas not long; for, sweeter than the rill340
To its old channel, or a swollen tide
To margin sallows, were the leaves he spied,
And flowers, and wreaths, and ready myrtle crowns
Up heaping through the slab: refreshment drowns
Itself, and strives its own delights to hide–
Nor in one spot alone; the floral pride
In a long whispering birth enchanted grew
Before his footsteps; as when heav'd anew
Old ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore,
Down whose green back the short-liv'd foam, all hoar,
Bursts gradual, with a wayward indolence.351
Increasing still in heart, and pleasant sense,
Upon his fairy journey on he hastes;
So anxious for the end, he scarcely wastes
One moment with his hand among the sweets:
Onward he goes–he stops–his bosom beats
As plainly in his ear, as the faint charm
Of which the throbs were born. This still alarm,
This sleepy music, forc'd him walk tiptoe:
For it came more softly than the east could blow360
Arion's magic to the Atlantic isles;
Or than the west, made jealous by the smiles
Of thron'd Apollo, could breathe back the lyre
To seas Ionian and Tyrian.
O did he ever live, that lonely man,
Who lov'd–and music slew not? 'Tis the pest
Of love, that fairest joys give most unrest;
That things of delicate and tenderest worth
Are swallow'd all, and made a seared dearth,
By one consuming flame: it doth immerse370
And suffocate true blessings in a curse.
Half-happy, by comparison of bliss,
Is miserable. 'Twas even so with this
Dew-dropping melody, in the Carian's ear;
First heaven, then hell, and then forgotten clear,
Vanish'd in elemental passion.
And down some swart abysm he had gone,
Had not a heavenly guide benignant led
To where thick myrtle branches, 'gainst his head
Brushing, awakened: then the sounds again380
Went noiseless as a passing noontide rain
Over a bower, where little space he stood;
For as the sunset peeps into a wood
So saw he panting light, and towards it went
Through winding alleys; and lo, wonderment!
Upon soft verdure saw, one here, one there,
Cupids a slumbering on their pinions fair.
After a thousand mazes overgone,
At last, with sudden step, he came upon
A chamber, myrtle wall'd, embowered high,390
Full of light, incense, tender minstrelsy,
And more of beautiful and strange beside:
For on a silken couch of rosy pride,
In midst of all, there lay a sleeping youth
Of fondest beauty; fonder, in fair sooth,
Than sighs could fathom, or contentment reach:
And coverlids gold-tinted like the peach,
Or ripe October's faded marigolds,
Fell sleek about him in a thousand folds–
Not hiding up an Apollonian curve400
Of neck and shoulder, nor the tenting swerve
Of knee from knee, nor ankles pointing light;
But rather, giving them to the filled sight
Officiously. Sideway his face repos'd
On one white arm, and tenderly unclos'd,
By tenderest pressure, a faint damask mouth
To slumbery pout; just as the morning south
Disparts a dew-lipp'd rose. Above his head,
Four lily stalks did their white honours wed
To make a coronal; and round him grew410
All tendrils green, of every bloom and hue,
Together intertwin'd and trammel'd fresh:
The vine of glossy sprout; the ivy mesh,
Shading its Ethiop berries; and woodbine,
Of velvet leaves and bugle-blooms divine;
Convolvulus in streaked vases flush;
The creeper, mellowing for an autumn blush;
And virgin's bower, trailing airily;
With others of the sisterhood. Hard by,
Stood serene Cupids watching silently.420
One, kneeling to a lyre, touch'd the strings,
Muffling to death the pathos with his wings;
And, ever and anon, uprose to look
At the youth's slumber; while another took
A willow-bough, distilling odorous dew,
And shook it on his hair; another flew
In through the woven roof, and fluttering-wise
Rain'd violets upon his sleeping eyes.
At these enchantments, and yet many more,
The breathless Latmian wonder'd o'er and o'er;430
Until, impatient in embarrassment,
He forthright pass'd, and lightly treading went
To that same feather'd lyrist, who straightway,
Smiling, thus whisper'd: "Though from upper day
Thou art a wanderer, and thy presence here
Might seem unholy, be of happy cheer!
For 'tis the nicest touch of human honour,
When some ethereal and high-favouring donor
Presents immortal bowers to mortal sense;
As now 'tis done to thee, Endymion. Hence440
Was I in no wise startled. So recline
Upon these living flowers. Here is wine,
Alive with sparkles–never, I aver,
Since Ariadne was a vintager,
So cool a purple: taste these juicy pears,
Sent me by sad Vertumnus, when his fears
Were high about Pomona: here is cream,
Deepening to richness from a snowy gleam;
Sweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm'd
For the boy Jupiter: and here, undimm'd450
By any touch, a bunch of blooming plums
Ready to melt between an infant's gums:
And here is manna pick'd from Syrian trees,
In starlight, by the three Hesperides.
Feast on, and meanwhile I will let thee know
Of all these things around us." He did so,
Still brooding o'er the cadence of his lyre;
And thus: "I need not any hearing tire
By telling how the sea-born goddess pin'd
For a mortal youth, and how she strove to bind460
Him all in all unto her doting self.
Who would not be so prison'd? but, fond elf,
He was content to let her amorous plea
Faint through his careless arms; content to see
An unseiz'd heaven dying at his feet;
Content, O fool! to make a cold retreat,
When on the pleasant grass such love, lovelorn,
Lay sorrowing; when every tear was born
Of diverse passion; when her lips and eyes
Were clos'd in sullen moisture, and quick sighs470
Came vex'd and pettish through her nostrils small.
Hush! no exclaim–yet, justly mightst thou call
Curses upon his head.–I was half glad,
But my poor mistress went distract and mad,
When the boar tusk'd him: so away she flew
To Jove's high throne, and by her plainings drew
Immortal tear-drops down the thunderer's beard;
Whereon, it was decreed he should be rear'd
Each summer time to life. Lo! this is he,
That same Adonis, safe in the privacy480
Of this still region all his winter-sleep.
Aye, sleep; for when our love-sick queen did weep
Over his waned corse, the tremulous shower
Heal'd up the wound, and, with a balmy power,
Medicined death to a lengthened drowsiness:
The which she fills with visions, and doth dress
In all this quiet luxury; and hath set
Us young immortals, without any let,
To watch his slumber through. 'Tis well nigh pass'd,
Even to a moment's filling up, and fast490
She scuds with summer breezes, to pant through
The first long kiss, warm firstling, to renew
Embower'd sports in Cytherea's isle.
Look! how those winged listeners all this while
Stand anxious: see! behold!"–This clamant word
Broke through the careful silence; for they heard
A rustling noise of leaves, and out there flutter'd
Pigeons and doves: Adonis something mutter'd,
The while one hand, that erst upon his thigh
Lay dormant, mov'd convuls'd and gradually500
Up to his forehead. Then there was a hum
Of sudden voices, echoing, "Come! come!
Arise! awake! Clear summer has forth walk'd
Unto the clover-sward, and she has talk'd
Full soothingly to every nested finch:
Rise, Cupids! or we'll give the blue-bell pinch
To your dimpled arms. Once more sweet life begin!"
At this, from every side they hurried in,
Rubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists,
And doubling over head their little fists510
In backward yawns. But all were soon alive:
For as delicious wine doth, sparkling, dive
In nectar'd clouds and curls through water fair,
So from the arbour roof down swell'd an air
Odorous and enlivening; making all
To laugh, and play, and sing, and loudly call
For their sweet queen: when lo! the wreathed green
Disparted, and far upward could be seen
Blue heaven, and a silver car, air-borne,
Whose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn,
Spun off a drizzling dew,–which falling chill521
On soft Adonis' shoulders, made him still
Nestle and turn uneasily about.
Soon were the white doves plain, with necks stretch'd out,
And silken traces lighten'd in descent;
And soon, returning from love's banishment,
Queen Venus leaning downward open arm'd:
Her shadow fell upon his breast, and charm'd
A tumult to his heart, and a new life
Into his eyes. Ah, miserable strife,530
But for her comforting! unhappy sight,
But meeting her blue orbs! Who, who can write
Of these first minutes? The unchariest muse
To embracements warm as theirs makes coy excuse.
O it has ruffled every spirit there,
Saving love's self, who stands superb to share
The general gladness: awfully he stands;
A sovereign quell is in his waving hands;
No sight can bear the lightning of his bow;
His quiver is mysterious, none can know540
What themselves think of it; from forth his eyes
There darts strange light of varied hues and dyes:
A scowl is sometimes on his brow, but who
Look full upon it feel anon the blue
Of his fair eyes run liquid through their souls.
Endymion feels it, and no more controls
The burning prayer within him; so, bent low,
He had begun a plaining of his woe.
But Venus, bending forward, said: "My child,
Favour this gentle youth; his days are wild550
With love–he–but alas! too well I see
Thou know'st the deepness of his misery.
Ah, smile not so, my son: I tell thee true,
That when through heavy hours I used to rue
The endless sleep of this new-born Adon',
This stranger ay I pitied. For upon
A dreary morning once I fled away
Into the breezy clouds, to weep and pray
For this my love: for vexing Mars had teaz'd
Me even to tears: thence, when a little eas'd,560
Down-looking, vacant, through a hazy wood,
I saw this youth as he despairing stood:
Those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind;
Those same full fringed lids a constant blind
Over his sullen eyes: I saw him throw
Himself on wither'd leaves, even as though
Death had come sudden; for no jot he mov'd,
Yet mutter'd wildly. I could hear he lov'd
Some fair immortal, and that his embrace
Had zoned her through the night. There is no trace570
Of this in heaven: I have mark'd each cheek,
And find it is the vainest thing to seek;
And that of all things 'tis kept secretest.
Endymion! one day thou wilt be blest:
So still obey the guiding hand that fends
Thee safely through these wonders for sweet ends.
'Tis a concealment needful in extreme;
And if I guess'd not so, the sunny beam
Thou shouldst mount up to with me. Now adieu!
Here must we leave thee."–At these words up flew580
The impatient doves, up rose the floating car,
Up went the hum celestial. High afar
The Latmian saw them minish into nought;
And, when all were clear vanish'd, still he caught
A vivid lightning from that dreadful bow.
When all was darkened, with Etnean throe
The earth clos'd–gave a solitary moan–
And left him once again in twilight lone.
He did not rave, he did not stare aghast,
For all those visions were o'ergone, and past,590
And he in loneliness: he felt assur'd
Of happy times, when all he had endur'd
Would seem a feather to the mighty prize.
So, with unusual gladness, on he hies
Through caves, and palaces of mottled ore,
Gold dome, and crystal wall, and turquois floor,
Black polish'd porticos of awful shade,
And, at the last, a diamond balustrade,
Leading afar past wild magnificence,
Spiral through ruggedest loopholes, and thence600
Stretching across a void, then guiding o'er
Enormous chasms, where, all foam and roar,
Streams subterranean tease their granite beds;
Then heighten'd just above the silvery heads
Of a thousand fountains, so that he could dash
The waters with his spear; but at the splash,
Done heedlessly, those spouting columns rose
Sudden a poplar's height, and 'gan to enclose
His diamond path with fretwork, streaming round
Alive, and dazzling cool, and with a sound,610
Haply, like dolphin tumults, when sweet shells
Welcome the float of Thetis. Long he dwells
On this delight; for, every minute's space,
The streams with changed magic interlace:
Sometimes like delicatest lattices,
Cover'd with crystal vines; then weeping trees,
Moving about as in a gentle wind,
Which, in a wink, to watery gauze refin'd,
Pour'd into shapes of curtain'd canopies,
Spangled, and rich with liquid broideries620
Of flowers, peacocks, swans, and naiads fair.
Swifter than lightning went these wonders rare;
And then the water, into stubborn streams
Collecting, mimick'd the wrought oaken beams,
Pillars, and frieze, and high fantastic roof,
Of those dusk places in times far aloof
Cathedrals call'd. He bade a loth farewel
To these founts Protean, passing gulph, and dell,
And torrent, and ten thousand jutting shapes,
Half seen through deepest gloom, and griesly gapes,630
Blackening on every side, and overhead
A vaulted dome like Heaven's, far bespread
With starlight gems: aye, all so huge and strange,
The solitary felt a hurried change
Working within him into something dreary,–
Vex'd like a morning eagle, lost, and weary,
And purblind amid foggy, midnight wolds.
But he revives at once: for who beholds
New sudden things, nor casts his mental slough?
Forth from a rugged arch, in the dusk below,640
Came mother Cybele! alone–alone–
In sombre chariot; dark foldings thrown
About her majesty, and front death-pale,
With turrets crown'd. Four maned lions hale
The sluggish wheels; solemn their toothed maws,
Their surly eyes brow-hidden, heavy paws
Uplifted drowsily, and nervy tails
Cowering their tawny brushes. Silent sails
This shadowy queen athwart, and faints away

In another gloomy arch.		650

Wherefore delay,
Young traveller, in such a mournful place?
Art thou wayworn, or canst not further trace
The diamond path? And does it indeed end
Abrupt in middle air? Yet earthward bend
Thy forehead, and to Jupiter cloud-borne
Call ardently! He was indeed wayworn;
Abrupt, in middle air, his way was lost;
To cloud-borne Jove he bowed, and there crost
Towards him a large eagle, 'twixt whose wings,660
Without one impious word, himself he flings,
Committed to the darkness and the gloom:
Down, down, uncertain to what pleasant doom,
Swift as a fathoming plummet down he fell
Through unknown things; till exhaled asphodel,
And rose, with spicy fannings interbreath'd,
Came swelling forth where little caves were wreath'd
So thick with leaves and mosses, that they seem'd
Large honey-combs of green, and freshly teem'd
With airs delicious. In the greenest nook670
The eagle landed him, and farewel took.
It was a jasmine bower, all bestrown
With golden moss. His every sense had grown
Ethereal for pleasure; 'bove his head
Flew a delight half-graspable; his tread
Was Hesperean; to his capable ears
Silence was music from the holy spheres;
A dewy luxury was in his eyes;
The little flowers felt his pleasant sighs
And stirr'd them faintly. Verdant cave and cell680
He wander'd through, oft wondering at such swell
Of sudden exaltation: but, "Alas!
Said he, "will all this gush of feeling pass
Away in solitude? And must they wane,
Like melodies upon a sandy plain,
Without an echo? Then shall I be left
So sad, so melancholy, so bereft!
Yet still I feel immortal! O my love,
My breath of life, where art thou? High above,
Dancing before the morning gates of heaven?690
Or keeping watch among those starry seven,
Old Atlas' children? Art a maid of the waters,
One of shell-winding Triton's bright-hair'd daughters?
Or art, impossible! a nymph of Dian's,
Weaving a coronal of tender scions
For very idleness? Where'er thou art,
Methinks it now is at my will to start
Into thine arms; to scare Aurora's train,
And snatch thee from the morning; o'er the main
To scud like a wild bird, and take thee off700
From thy sea-foamy cradle; or to doff
Thy shepherd vest, and woo thee mid fresh leaves.
No, no, too eagerly my soul deceives
Its powerless self: I know this cannot be.
O let me then by some sweet dreaming flee
To her entrancements: hither sleep awhile!
Hither most gentle sleep! and soothing foil
For some few hours the coming solitude."
Thus spake he, and that moment felt endued
With power to dream deliciously; so wound710
Through a dim passage, searching till he found
The smoothest mossy bed and deepest, where
He threw himself, and just into the air
Stretching his indolent arms, he took, O bliss!
A naked waist: "Fair Cupid, whence is this?"
A well-known voice sigh'd, "Sweetest, here am I!"
At which soft ravishment, with doating cry
They trembled to each other.–Helicon!
O fountain'd hill! Old Homer's Helicon!
That thou wouldst spout a little streamlet o'er720
These sorry pages; then the verse would soar
And sing above this gentle pair, like lark
Over his nested young: but all is dark
Around thine aged top, and thy clear fount
Exhales in mists to heaven. Aye, the count
Of mighty Poets is made up; the scroll
Is folded by the Muses; the bright roll
Is in Apollo's hand: our dazed eyes
Have seen a new tinge in the western skies:
The world has done its duty. Yet, oh yet,730
Although the sun of poesy is set,
These lovers did embrace, and we must weep
That there is no old power left to steep
A quill immortal in their joyous tears.
Long time in silence did their anxious fears
Question that thus it was; long time they lay
Fondling and kissing every doubt away;
Long time ere soft caressing sobs began
To mellow into words, and then there ran
Two bubbling springs of talk from their sweet lips.740
"O known Unknown! from whom my being sips
Such darling essence, wherefore may I not
Be ever in these arms? in this sweet spot
Pillow my chin for ever? ever press
These toying hands and kiss their smooth excess?
Why not for ever and for ever feel
That breath about my eyes? Ah, thou wilt steal
Away from me again, indeed, indeed–
Thou wilt be gone away, and wilt not heed
My lonely madness. Speak, my kindest fair!750
Is–is it to be so? No! Who will dare
To pluck thee from me? And, of thine own will,
Full well I feel thou wouldst not leave me. Still
Let me entwine thee surer, surer–now
How can we part? Elysium! who art thou?
Who, that thou canst not be for ever here,
Or lift me with thee to some starry sphere?
Enchantress! tell me by this soft embrace,
By the most soft completion of thy face,
Those lips, O slippery blisses, twinkling eyes,760
And by these tenderest, milky sovereignties–
These tenderest, and by the nectar-wine,
The passion"—"O lov'd Ida the divine!
Endymion! dearest! Ah, unhappy me!
His soul will 'scape us–O felicity!
How he does love me! His poor temples beat
To the very tune of love–how sweet, sweet, sweet.
Revive, dear youth, or I shall faint and die;
Revive, or these soft hours will hurry by
In tranced dulness; speak, and let that spell770
Affright this lethargy! I cannot quell
Its heavy pressure, and will press at least
My lips to thine, that they may richly feast
Until we taste the life of love again.
What! dost thou move? dost kiss? O bliss! O pain!
I love thee, youth, more than I can conceive;
And so long absence from thee doth bereave
My soul of any rest: yet must I hence:
Yet, can I not to starry eminence
Uplift thee; nor for very shame can own780
Myself to thee. Ah, dearest, do not groan
Or thou wilt force me from this secrecy,
And I must blush in heaven. O that I
Had done it already; that the dreadful smiles
At my lost brightness, my impassion'd wiles,
Had waned from Olympus' solemn height,
And from all serious Gods; that our delight
Was quite forgotten, save of us alone!
And wherefore so ashamed? 'Tis but to atone
For endless pleasure, by some coward blushes:790
Yet must I be a coward!–Honour rushes
Too palpable before me–the sad look
Of Jove–Minerva's start–no bosom shook
With awe of purity–no Cupid pinion
In reverence veiled–my crystalline dominion
Half lost, and all old hymns made nullity!
But what is this to love? O I could fly
With thee into the ken of heavenly powers,
So thou wouldst thus, for many sequent hours,
Press me so sweetly. Now I swear at once800
That I am wise, that Pallas is a dunce–
Perhaps her love like mine is but unknown–
O I do think that I have been alone
In chastity: yes, Pallas has been sighing,
While every eye saw me my hair uptying
With fingers cool as aspen leaves. Sweet love,
I was as vague as solitary dove,
Nor knew that nests were built. Now a soft kiss–
Aye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss,
An immortality of passion's thine:810
Ere long I will exalt thee to the shine
Of heaven ambrosial; and we will shade
Ourselves whole summers by a river glade;
And I will tell thee stories of the sky,
And breathe thee whispers of its minstrelsy.
My happy love will overwing all bounds!
O let me melt into thee; let the sounds
Of our close voices marry at their birth;
Let us entwine hoveringly–O dearth
Of human words! roughness of mortal speech!820
Lispings empyrean will I sometime teach
Thine honied tongue–lute-breathings, which I gasp
To have thee understand, now while I clasp
Thee thus, and weep for fondness–I am pain'd,
Endymion: woe! woe! is grief contain'd
In the very deeps of pleasure, my sole life?"–
Hereat, with many sobs, her gentle strife
Melted into a languor. He return'd

Entranced vows and tears.

Ye who have yearn'd	830
With too much passion, will here stay and pity,
For the mere sake of truth; as 'tis a ditty
Not of these days, but long ago 'twas told
By a cavern wind unto a forest old;
And then the forest told it in a dream
To a sleeping lake, whose cool and level gleam
A poet caught as he was journeying
To Phœbus' shrine; and in it he did fling
His weary limbs, bathing an hour's space,
And after, straight in that inspired place840
He sang the story up into the air,
Giving it universal freedom. There
Has it been ever sounding for those ears
Whose tips are glowing hot. The legend cheers
Yon centinel stars; and he who listens to it
Must surely be self-doomed or he will rue it:
For quenchless burnings come upon the heart,
Made fiercer by a fear lest any part
Should be engulphed in the eddying wind.
As much as here is penn'd doth always find850
A resting place, thus much comes clear and plain;
Anon the strange voice is upon the wane–
And 'tis but echo'd from departing sound,
That the fair visitant at last unwound
Her gentle limbs, and left the youth asleep.–
Thus the tradition of the gusty deep.
Now turn we to our former chroniclers.–
Endymion awoke, that grief of hers
Sweet paining on his ear: he sickly guess'd
How lone he was once more, and sadly press'd860
His empty arms together, hung his head,
And most forlorn upon that widow'd bed
Sat silently. Love's madness he had known:
Often with more than tortured lion's groan
Moanings had burst from him; but now that rage
Had pass'd away: no longer did he wage
A rough-voic'd war against the dooming stars.
No, he had felt too much for such harsh jars:
The lyre of his soul Eolian tun'd
Forgot all violence, and but commun'd870
With melancholy thought: O he had swoon'd
Drunken from pleasure's nipple; and his love
Henceforth was dove-like.–Loth was he to move
From the imprinted couch, and when he did,
'Twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid
In muffling hands. So temper'd, out he stray'd
Half seeing visions that might have dismay'd
Alecto's serpents; ravishments more keen
Than Hermes' pipe, when anxious he did lean
Over eclipsing eyes: and at the last880
It was a sounding grotto, vaulted, vast,
O'er studded with a thousand, thousand pearls,
And crimson mouthed shells with stubborn curls,
Of every shape and size, even to the bulk
In which whales arbour close, to brood and sulk
Against an endless storm. Moreover too,
Fish-semblances, of green and azure hue,
Ready to snort their streams. In this cool wonder
Endymion sat down, and 'gan to ponder
On all his life: his youth, up to the day890
When 'mid acclaim, and feasts, and garlands gay,
He stept upon his shepherd throne: the look
Of his white palace in wild forest nook,
And all the revels he had lorded there:
Each tender maiden whom he once thought fair,
With every friend and fellow-woodlander–
Pass'd like a dream before him. Then the spur
Of the old bards to mighty deeds: his plans
To nurse the golden age 'mong shepherd clans:
That wondrous night: the great Pan-festival:900
His sister's sorrow; and his wanderings all,
Until into the earth's deep maw he rush'd:
Then all its buried magic, till it flush'd
High with excessive love. "And now," thought he,
"How long must I remain in jeopardy
Of blank amazements that amaze no more?
Now I have tasted her sweet soul to the core
All other depths are shallow: essences,
Once spiritual, are like muddy lees,
Meant but to fertilize my earthly root,910
And make my branches lift a golden fruit
Into the bloom of heaven: other light,
Though it be quick and sharp enough to blight
The Olympian eagle's vision, is dark,
Dark as the parentage of chaos. Hark!
My silent thoughts are echoing from these shells;
Or they are but the ghosts, the dying swells
Of noises far away?–list!"–Hereupon
He kept an anxious ear. The humming tone
Came louder, and behold, there as he lay,920
On either side outgush'd, with misty spray,
A copious spring; and both together dash'd
Swift, mad, fantastic round the rocks, and lash'd
Among the conchs and shells of the lofty grot,
Leaving a trickling dew. At last they shot
Down from the ceiling's height, pouring a noise
As of some breathless racers whose hopes poize
Upon the last few steps, and with spent force
Along the ground they took a winding course.
Endymion follow'd–for it seem'd that one930
Ever pursued, the other strove to shun–
Follow'd their languid mazes, till well nigh
He had left thinking of the mystery,–
And was now rapt in tender hoverings
Over the vanish'd bliss. Ah! what is it sings
His dream away? What melodies are these?
They sound as through the whispering of trees,
Not native in such barren vaults. Give ear!
"O Arethusa, peerless nymph! why fear
Such tenderness as mine? Great Dian, why,940
Why didst thou hear her prayer? O that I
Were rippling round her dainty fairness now,
Circling about her waist, and striving how
To entice her to a dive! then stealing in
Between her luscious lips and eyelids thin.
O that her shining hair was in the sun,
And I distilling from it thence to run
In amorous rillets down her shrinking form!
To linger on her lily shoulders, warm
Between her kissing breasts, and every charm950
Touch raptur'd!–See how painfully I flow:
Fair maid, be pitiful to my great woe.
Stay, stay thy weary course, and let me lead,
A happy wooer, to the flowery mead
Where all that beauty snar'd me."–"Cruel god,
Desist! or my offended mistress' nod
Will stagnate all thy fountains:–tease me not
With syren words–Ah, have I really got
Such power to madden thee? And is it true–
Away, away, or I shall dearly rue960
My very thoughts: in mercy then away,
Kindest Alpheus, for should I obey
My own dear will, 'twould be a deadly bane."–
"O, Oread-Queen! would that thou hadst a pain
Like this of mine, then would I fearless turn
And be a criminal."–"Alas, I burn,
I shudder–gentle river, get thee hence.
Alpheus! thou enchanter! every sense
Of mine was once made perfect in these woods.
Fresh breezes, bowery lawns, and innocent floods,970
Ripe fruits, and lonely couch, contentment gave;
But ever since I heedlessly did lave
In thy deceitful stream, a panting glow
Grew strong within me: wherefore serve me so,
And call it love? Alas, 'twas cruelty.
Not once more did I close my happy eyes
Amid the thrush's song. Away! Avaunt!
O 'twas a cruel thing."–"Now thou dost taunt
So softly, Arethusa, that I think
If thou wast playing on my shady brink,980
Thou wouldst bathe once again. Innocent maid!
Stifle thine heart no more:–nor be afraid
Of angry powers: there are deities
Will shade us with their wings. Those fitful sighs
'Tis almost death to hear: O let me pour
A dewy balm upon them!–fear no more,
Sweet Arethusa! Dian's self must feel
Sometimes these very pangs. Dear maiden, steal
Blushing into my soul, and let us fly
These dreary caverns for the open sky.990
I will delight thee all my winding course,
From the green sea up to my hidden source
About Arcadian forests; and will shew
The channels where my coolest waters flow
Through mossy rocks; where, 'mid exuberant green,
I roam in pleasant darkness, more unseen
Than Saturn in his exile; where I brim
Round flowery islands, and take thence a skim
Of mealy sweets, which myriads of bees
Buzz from their honied wings: and thou shouldst please
Thyself to choose the richest, where we might1001
Be incense-pillow'd every summer night.
Doff all sad fears, thou white deliciousness,
And let us be thus comforted; unless
Thou couldst rejoice to see my hopeless stream
Hurry distracted from Sol's temperate beam,
And pour to death along some hungry sands."–
"What can I do, Alpheus? Dian stands
Severe before me: persecuting fate!
Unhappy Arethusa! thou wast late1010
A huntress free in"–At this, sudden fell
Those two sad streams adown a fearful dell.
The Latmian listen'd, but he heard no more,
Save echo, faint repeating o'er and o'er
The name of Arethusa. On the verge
Of that dark gulph he wept, and said: "I urge
Thee, gentle Goddess of my pilgrimage,
By our eternal hopes, to soothe, to assuage,
If thou art powerful, these lovers pains;
And make them happy in some happy plains.1020
He turn'd–there was a whelming sound–he stept,
There was a cooler light; and so he kept
Towards it by a sandy path, and lo!
More suddenly than doth a moment go,
The visions of the earth were gone and fled–
He saw the giant sea above his head.
ENDYMION.
BOOK III.

There are who lord it o'er their fellow-men
With most prevailing tinsel: who unpen
Their baaing vanities, to browse away
The comfortable green and juicy hay
From human pastures; or, O torturing fact!
Who, through an idiot blink, will see unpack'd
Fire-branded foxes to sear up and singe
Our gold and ripe-ear'd hopes. With not one tinge
Of sanctuary splendour, not a sight
Able to face an owl's, they still are dight10
By the blear-eyed nations in empurpled vests,
And crowns, and turbans. With unladen breasts,
Save of blown self-applause, they proudly mount
To their spirit's perch, their being's high account,
Their tiptop nothings, their dull skies, their thrones–
Amid the fierce intoxicating tones
Of trumpets, shoutings, and belabour'd drums,
And sudden cannon. All! how all this hums,
In wakeful ears, like uproar past and gone–
Like thunder clouds that spake to Babylon,20
And set those old Chaldeans to their tasks.–
Are then regalities all gilded masks?
No, there are throned seats unscalable
But by a patient wing, a constant spell,
Or by ethereal things that, unconfin'd,
Can make a ladder of the eternal wind,
And poise about in cloudy thunder-tents
To watch the abysm-birth of elements.
Aye, 'bove the withering of old-lipp'd Fate
A thousand Powers keep religious state,30
In water, fiery realm, and airy bourne;
And, silent as a consecrated urn,
Hold sphery sessions for a season due.
Yet few of these far majesties, ah, few!
Have bared their operations to this globe–
Few, who with gorgeous pageantry enrobe
Our piece of heaven–whose benevolence
Shakes hand with our own Ceres; every sense
Filling with spiritual sweets to plenitude,
As bees gorge full their cells. And, by the feud40
'Twixt Nothing and Creation, I here swear,
Eterne Apollo! that thy Sister fair
Is of all these the gentlier-mightiest.
When thy gold breath is misting in the west,
She unobserved steals unto her throne,
And there she sits most meek and most alone;
As if she had not pomp subservient;
As if thine eye, high Poet! was not bent
Towards her with the Muses in thine heart;
As if the ministring stars kept not apart,50
Waiting for silver-footed messages.
O Moon! the oldest shades 'mong oldest trees
Feel palpitations when thou lookest in:
O Moon! old boughs lisp forth a holier din
The while they feel thine airy fellowship.
Thou dost bless every where, with silver lip
Kissing dead things to life. The sleeping kine,
Couched in thy brightness, dream of fields divine:
Innumerable mountains rise, and rise,
Ambitious for the hallowing of thine eyes;60
And yet thy benediction passeth not
One obscure hiding-place, one little spot
Where pleasure may be sent: the nested wren
Has thy fair face within its tranquil ken,
And from beneath a sheltering ivy leaf
Takes glimpses of thee; thou art a relief
To the poor patient oyster, where it sleeps
Within its pearly house.–The mighty deeps,
The monstrous sea is thine–the myriad sea!
O Moon! far-spooming Ocean bows to thee,70
And Tellus feels his forehead's cumbrous load.

Cynthia! where art thou now? What far abode
Of green or silvery bower doth enshrine
Such utmost beauty? Alas, thou dost pine
For one as sorrowful: thy cheek is pale
For one whose cheek is pale: thou dost bewail
His tears, who weeps for thee. Where dost thou sigh?
Ah! surely that light peeps from Vesper's eye,
Or what a thing is love! 'Tis She, but lo!
How chang'd, how full of ache, how gone in woe!80
She dies at the thinnest cloud; her loveliness
Is wan on Neptune's blue: yet there's a stress
Of love-spangles, just off yon cape of trees,
Dancing upon the waves, as if to please
The curly foam with amorous influence.
O, not so idle: for down-glancing thence
She fathoms eddies, and runs wild about
O'erwhelming water-courses; scaring out
The thorny sharks from hiding-holes, and fright'ning
Their savage eyes with unaccustomed lightning.90
Where will the splendor be content to reach?
O love! how potent hast thou been to teach
Strange journeyings! Wherever beauty dwells,
In gulf or aerie, mountains or deep dells,
In light, in gloom, in star or blazing sun,
Thou pointest out the way, and straight 'tis won.
Amid his toil thou gav'st Leander breath;
Thou leddest Orpheus through the gleams of death;
Thou madest Pluto bear thin element;
And now, O winged Chieftain! them hast sent100
A moon-beam to the deep, deep water-world,

To find Endymion.

On gold sand impearl'd
With lily shells, and pebbles milky white,
Poor Cynthia greeted him, and sooth'd her light
Against his pallid face: he felt the charm
To breathlessness, and suddenly a warm
Of his heart's blood: 'twas very sweet; he stay'd
His wandering steps, and half-entranced laid
His head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,110
To taste the gentle moon, and freshening beads,
Lashed from the crystal roof by fishes' tails.
And so he kept, until the rosy veils
Mantling the east, by Aurora's peering hand
Were lifted from the water's breast, and faun'd
Into sweet air; and sober'd morning came
Meekly through billows:–when like taper-flame
Left sudden by a dallying breath of air,
He rose in silence, and once more 'gan fare
Along his fated way.		120

Far had he roam'd,
With nothing save the hollow vast, that foam'd
Above, around, and at his feet; save things
More dead than Morpheus' imaginings:
Old rusted anchors, helmets, breast-plates large
Of gone sea-warriors; brazen beaks and targe;
Rudders that for a hundred years had lost
The sway of human hand; gold vase emboss'd
With long-forgotten story, and wherein
No reveller had ever dipp'd a chin130
But those of Saturn's vintage; mouldering scrolls,
Writ in the tongue of heaven, by those souls
Who first were on the earth; and sculptures rude
In ponderous stone, developing the mood
Of ancient Nox;–then skeletons of man,
Of beast, behemoth, and leviathan,
And elephant, and eagle, and huge jaw
Of nameless monster. A cold leaden awe
These secrets struck into him; and unless
Dian had chaced away that heaviness,140
He might have died: but now, with cheered feel,
He onward kept; wooing these thoughts to steal
About the labyrinth in his soul of love.
"What is there in thee, Moon! that thou shouldst move
My heart so potently? When yet a child
I oft have dried my tears when thou hast smil'd.
Thou seem'dst my sister: hand in hand we went
From eve to morn across the firmament.
No apples would I gather from the tree,
Till thou hadst cool'd their cheeks deliciously:150
No tumbling water ever spake romance,
But when my eyes with thine thereon could dance:
No woods were green enough, no bower divine,
Until thou liftedst up thine eyelids fine:
In sowing time ne'er would I dibble take,
Or drop a seed, till thou wast wide awake;
And, in the summer tide of blossoming,
No one but thee hath heard me blithly sing
And mesh my dewy flowers all the night.
No melody was like a passing spright160
If it went not to solemnize thy reign.
Yes, in my boyhood, every joy and pain
By thee were fashion'd to the self-same end;
And as I grew in years, still didst thou blend
With all my ardours: thou wast the deep glen;
Thou wast the mountain-top–the sage's pen–
The poet's harp–the voice of friends–the sun;
Thou wast the river–thou wast glory won;
Thou wast my clarion's blast–thou wast my steed–
My goblet full of wine–my topmost deed:–170
Thou wast the charm of women, lovely Moon!
O what a wild and harmonized tune
My spirit struck from all the beautiful!
On some bright essence could I lean, and lull
Myself to immortality: I prest
Nature's soft pillow in a wakeful rest.
But, gentle Orb! there came a nearer bliss–
My strange love came–Felicity's abyss!
She came, and thou didst fade, and fade away–
Yet not entirely; no, thy starry sway180
Has been an under-passion to this hour.
Now I begin to feel thine orby power
Is coming fresh upon me: O be kind,
Keep back thine influence, and do not blind
My sovereign vision.–Dearest love, forgive
That I can think away from thee and live!–
Pardon me, airy planet, that I prize
One thought beyond thine argent luxuries!
How far beyond!" At this a surpris'd start
Frosted the springing verdure of his heart;190
For as he lifted up his eyes to swear
How his own goddess was past all things fair,
He saw far in the concave green of the sea
An old man sitting calm and peacefully.
Upon a weeded rock this old man sat,
And his white hair was awful, and a mat
Of weeds were cold beneath his cold thin feet;
And, ample as the largest winding-sheet,
A cloak of blue wrapp'd up his aged bones,
O'erwrought with symbols by the deepest groans200
Of ambitious magic: every ocean-form
Was woven in with black distinctness; storm,
And calm, and whispering, and hideous roar
Were emblem'd in the woof; with every shape
That skims, or dives, or sleeps, 'twixt cape and cape.
The gulphing whale was like a dot in the spell,
Yet look upon it, and 'twould size and swell
To its huge self; and the minutest fish
Would pass the very hardest gazer's wish,
And shew his little eye's anatomy.210
Then there was pictur'd the regality
Of Neptune; and the sea nymphs round his state,
In beauteous vassalage, look up and wait.
Beside this old man lay a pearly wand,
And in his lap a book, the which he conn'd
So stedfastly, that the new denizen
Had time to keep him in amazed ken,
To mark these shadowings, and stand in awe.
The old man rais'd his hoary head and saw
The wilder'd stranger–seeming not to see,220
His features were so lifeless. Suddenly
He woke as from a trance; his snow-white brows
Went arching up, and like two magic ploughs
Furrow'd deep wrinkles in his forehead large,
Which kept as fixedly as rocky marge,
Till round his wither'd lips had gone a smile.
Then up he rose, like one whose tedious toil
Had watch'd for years in forlorn hermitage,
Who had not from mid-life to utmost age
Eas'd in one accent his o'er-burden'd soul,230
Even to the trees. He rose: he grasp'd his stole,
With convuls'd clenches waving it abroad,
And in a voice of solemn joy, that aw'd
Echo into oblivion, he said:–
"Thou art the man! Now shall I lay my head
In peace upon my watery pillow: now
Sleep will come smoothly to my weary brow.
O Jove! I shall be young again, be young!
O shell-borne Neptune, I am pierc'd and stung
With new-born life! What shall I do? Where go,240
When I have cast this serpent-skin of woe?–
I'll swim to the syrens, and one moment listen
Their melodies, and see their long hair glisten;
Anon upon that giant's arm I'll be,
That writhes about the roots of Sicily:
To northern seas I'll in a twinkling sail,
And mount upon the snortings of a whale
To some black cloud; thence down I'll madly sweep
On forked lightning, to the deepest deep,
Where through some sucking pool I will be hurl'd250
With rapture to the other side of the world!
O, I am full of gladness! Sisters three,
I bow full hearted to your old decree!
Yes, every god be thank'd, and power benign,
For I no more shall wither, droop, and pine.
Thou art the man!" Endymion started back
Dismay'd; and, like a wretch from whom the rack
Tortures hot breath, and speech of agony,
Mutter'd: "What lonely death am I to die
In this cold region? Will he let me freeze,260
And float my brittle limbs o'er polar seas?
Or will he touch me with his searing hand,
And leave a black memorial on the sand?
Or tear me piece-meal with a bony saw,
And keep me as a chosen food to draw
His magian fish through hated fire and flame?
O misery of hell! resistless, tame,
Am I to be burnt up? No, I will shout,
Until the gods through heaven's blue look out!–
O Tartarus! but some few days agone270
Her soft arms were entwining me, and on
Her voice I hung like fruit among green leaves:
Her lips were all my own, and–ah, ripe sheaves
Of happiness! ye on the stubble droop,
But never may be garner'd. I must stoop
My head, and kiss death's foot. Love! love, farewel!
Is there no hope from thee? This horrid spell
Would melt at thy sweet breath.–By Dian's hind
Feeding from her white fingers, on the wind
I see thy streaming hair! and now, by Pan,280
I care not for this old mysterious man!"
He spake, and walking to that aged form,
Look'd high defiance. Lo! his heart 'gan warm
With pity, for the grey-hair'd creature wept.
Had he then wrong'd a heart where sorrow kept?
Had he, though blindly contumelious, brought
Rheum to kind eyes, a sting to human thought,
Convulsion to a mouth of many years?
He had in truth; and he was ripe for tears.
The penitent shower fell, as down he knelt290
Before that care-worn sage, who trembling felt
About his large dark locks, and faultering spake:
"Arise, good youth, for sacred Phœbus' sake!
I know thine inmost bosom, and I feel
A very brother's yearning for thee steal
Into mine own: for why? thou openest
The prison gates that have so long opprest
My weary watching. Though thou know'st it not,
Thou art commission'd to this fated spot
For great enfranchisement. O weep no more;300
I am a friend to love, to loves of yore:
Aye, hadst thou never lov'd an unknown power,
I had been grieving at this joyous hour.
But even now most miserable old,
I saw thee, and my blood no longer cold
Gave mighty pulses: in this tottering case
Grew a new heart, which at this moment plays
As dancingly as thine. Be not afraid,
For thou shalt hear this secret all display'd,
Now as we speed towards our joyous task."310
So saying, this young soul in age's mask
Went forward with the Carian side by side:
Resuming quickly thus; while ocean's tide
Hung swollen at their backs, and jewel'd sands

Took silently their foot-prints.

"My soul stands
Now past the midway from mortality,
And so I can prepare without a sigh
To tell thee briefly all my joy and pain.
I was a fisher once, upon this main,320
And my boat danc'd in every creek and bay;
Rough billows were my home by night and day,–
The sea-gulls not more constant; for I had
No housing from the storm and tempests mad,
But hollow rocks,–and they were palaces
Of silent happiness, of slumberous ease:
Long years of misery have told me so.
Aye, thus it was one thousand years ago.
One thousand years!–Is it then possible
To look so plainly through them? to dispel330
A thousand years with backward glance sublime?
To breathe away as 'twere all scummy slime
From off a crystal pool, to see its deep,
And one's own image from the bottom peep?
Yes: now I am no longer wretched thrall,
My long captivity and moanings all
Are but a slime, a thin-pervading scum,
The which I breathe away, and thronging come
Like things of yesterday my youthful pleasures.
"I touch'd no lute, I sang not, trod no measures:
I was a lonely youth on desert shores.341
My sports were lonely, 'mid continuous roars,
And craggy isles, and sea-mew's plaintive cry
Plaining discrepant between sea and sky.
Dolphins were still my playmates; shapes unseen
Would let me feel their scales of gold and green,
Nor be my desolation; and, full oft,
When a dread waterspout had rear'd aloft
Its hungry hugeness, seeming ready ripe
To burst with hoarsest thunderings, and wipe350
My life away like a vast sponge of fate,
Some friendly monster, pitying my sad state,
Has dived to its foundations, gulph'd it down,
And left me tossing safely. But the crown
Of all my life was utmost quietude:
More did I love to lie in cavern rude,
Keeping in wait whole days for Neptune's voice,
And if it came at last, hark, and rejoice!
There blush'd no summer eve but I would steer
My skiff along green shelving coasts, to hear360
The shepherd's pipe come clear from aery steep,
Mingled with ceaseless bleatings of his sheep:
And never was a day of summer shine,
But I beheld its birth upon the brine:
For I would watch all night to see unfold
Heaven's gates, and Æthon snort his morning gold
Wide o'er the swelling streams: and constantly
At brim of day-tide, on some grassy lea,
My nets would be spread out, and I at rest.
The poor folk of the sea-country I blest370
With daily boon of fish most delicate:
They knew not whence this bounty, and elate
Would strew sweet flowers on a sterile beach.
"Why was I not contented? Wherefore reach
At things which, but for thee, O Latmian!
Had been my dreary death? Fool! I began
To feel distemper'd longings: to desire
The utmost privilege that ocean's sire
Could grant in benediction: to be free
Of all his kingdom. Long in misery380
I wasted, ere in one extremest fit
I plung'd for life or death. To interknit
One's senses with so dense a breathing stuff
Might seem a work of pain; so not enough
Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,
And buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt
Whole days and days in sheer astonishment;
Forgetful utterly of self-intent;
Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.
Then, like a new fledg'd bird that first doth shew390
His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,
I tried in fear the pinions of my will.
'Twas freedom! and at once I visited
The ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.
No need to tell thee of them, for I see
That thou hast been a witness–it must be–
For these I know thou canst not feel a drouth,
By the melancholy corners of that mouth.
So I will in my story straightway pass
To more immediate matter. Woe, alas!400
That love should be my bane! Ah, Scylla fair!
Why did poor Glaucus ever–ever dare
To sue thee to his heart? Kind stranger-youth!
I lov'd her to the very white of truth,
And she would not conceive it. Timid thing!
She fled me swift as sea-bird on the wing,
Round every isle, and point, and promontory,
From where large Hercules wound up his story
Far as Egyptian Nile. My passion grew
The more, the more I saw her dainty hue410
Gleam delicately through the azure clear:
Until 'twas too fierce agony to bear;
And in that agony, across my grief
It flash'd, that Circe might find some relief–
Cruel enchantress! So above the water
I rear'd my head, and look'd for Phœbus' daughter.
Ææa's isle was wondering at the moon:–
It seem'd to whirl around me, and a swoon
Left me dead-drifting to that fatal power.
"When I awoke, 'twas in a twilight bower;420
Just when the light of morn, with hum of bees,
Stole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees.
How sweet, and sweeter! for I heard a lyre,
And over it a sighing voice expire.
It ceased–I caught light footsteps; and anon
The fairest face that morn e'er look'd upon
Push'd through a screen of roses. Starry Jove!
With tears, and smiles, and honey-words she wove
A net whose thraldom was more bliss than all
The range of flower'd Elysium. Thus did fall430
The dew of her rich speech: "Ah! Art awake?
O let me hear thee speak, for Cupid's sake!
I am so oppress'd with joy! Why, I have shed
An urn of tears, as though thou wert cold dead;
And now I find thee living, I will pour
From these devoted eyes their silver store,
Until exhausted of the latest drop,
So it will pleasure thee, and force thee stop
Here, that I too may live: but if beyond
Such cool and sorrowful offerings, thou art fond440
Of soothing warmth, of dalliance supreme;
If thou art ripe to taste a long love dream;
If smiles, if dimples, tongues for ardour mute,
Hang in thy vision like a tempting fruit,
O let me pluck it for thee." Thus she link'd
Her charming syllables, till indistinct
Their music came to my o'er-sweeten'd soul;
And then she hover'd over me, and stole
So near, that if no nearer it had been
This furrow'd visage thou hadst never seen.450
"Young man of Latmos! thus particular
Am I, that thou may'st plainly see how far
This fierce temptation went: and thou may'st not
Exclaim, How then, was Scylla quite forgot?
"Who could resist? Who in this universe?
She did so breathe ambrosia; so immerse
My fine existence in a golden clime.
She took me like a child of suckling time,
And cradled me in roses. Thus condemn'd,
The current of my former life was stemm'd,460
And to this arbitrary queen of sense
I bow'd a tranced vassal: nor would thence
Have mov'd, even though Amphion's harp had woo'd
Me back to Scylla o'er the billows rude.
For as Apollo each eve doth devise
A new appareling for western skies;
So every eve, nay every spendthrift hour
Shed balmy consciousness within that bower.
And I was free of haunts umbrageous;
Could wander in the mazy forest-house470
Of squirrels, foxes shy, and antler'd deer,
And birds from coverts innermost and drear
Warbling for very joy mellifluous sorrow–

To me new born delights!

"Now let me borrow,
For moments few, a temperament as stern
As Pluto's sceptre, that my words not burn
These uttering lips, while I in calm speech tell
How specious heaven was changed to real hell.
"One morn she left me sleeping: half awake480
I sought for her smooth arms and lips, to slake
My greedy thirst with nectarous camel-draughts;
But she was gone. Whereat the barbed shafts
Of disappointment stuck in me so sore,
That out I ran and search'd the forest o'er.
Wandering about in pine and cedar gloom
Damp awe assail'd me; for there 'gan to boom
A sound of moan, an agony of sound,
Sepulchral from the distance all around.
Then came a conquering earth-thunder, and rumbled490
That fierce complain to silence: while I stumbled
Down a precipitous path, as if impell'd.
I came to a dark valley.–Groanings swell'd
Poisonous about my ears, and louder grew,
The nearer I approach'd a flame's gaunt blue,
That glar'd before me through a thorny brake.
This fire, like the eye of gordian snake,
Bewitch'd me towards; and I soon was near
A sight too fearful for the feel of fear:
In thicket hid I curs'd the haggard scene–500
The banquet of my arms, my arbour queen,
Seated upon an uptorn forest root;
And all around her shapes, wizard and brute,
Laughing, and wailing, groveling, serpenting,
Shewing tooth, tusk, and venom-bag, and sting!
O such deformities! Old Charon's self,
Should he give up awhile his penny pelf,
And take a dream 'mong rushes Stygian,
It could not be so phantasied. Fierce, wan,
And tyrannizing was the lady's look,510
As over them a gnarled staff she shook.
Oft-times upon the sudden she laugh'd out,
And from a basket emptied to the rout
Clusters of grapes, the which they raven'd quick
And roar'd for more; with many a hungry lick
About their shaggy jaws. Avenging, slow,
Anon she took a branch of mistletoe,
And emptied on't a black dull-gurgling phial:
Groan'd one and all, as if some piercing trial
Was sharpening for their pitiable bones.520
She lifted up the charm: appealing groans
From their poor breasts went sueing to her ear
In vain; remorseless as an infant's bier
She whisk'd against their eyes the sooty oil.
Whereat was heard a noise of painful toil,
Increasing gradual to a tempest rage,
Shrieks, yells, and groans of torture-pilgrimage;
Until their grieved bodies 'gan to bloat
And puff from the tail's end to stifled throat:
Then was appalling silence: then a sight530
More wildering than all that hoarse affright;
For the whole herd, as by a whirlwind writhen,
Went through the dismal air like one huge Python
Antagonizing Boreas,–and so vanish'd.
Yet there was not a breath of wind: she banish'd
These phantoms with a nod. Lo! from the dark
Came waggish fauns, and nymphs, and satyrs stark,
With dancing and loud revelry,–and went
Swifter than centaurs after rapine bent.–
Sighing an elephant appear'd and bow'd540
Before the fierce witch, speaking thus aloud
In human accent: "Potent goddess! chief
Of pains resistless! make my being brief,
Or let me from this heavy prison fly:
Or give me to the air, or let me die!
I sue not for my happy crown again;
I sue not for my phalanx on the plain;
I sue not for my lone, my widow'd wife;
I sue not for my ruddy drops of life,
My children fair, my lovely girls and boys!550
I will forget them; I will pass these joys;
Ask nought so heavenward, so too–too high:
Only I pray, as fairest boon, to die,
Or be deliver'd from this cumbrous flesh,
From this gross, detestable, filthy mesh,
And merely given to the cold bleak air.
Have mercy, Goddess! Circe, feel my prayer!"
That curst magician's name fell icy numb
Upon my wild conjecturing: truth had come
Naked and sabre-like against my heart.560
I saw a fury whetting a death-dart;
And my slain spirit, overwrought with fright,
Fainted away in that dark lair of night.
Think, my deliverer, how desolate
My waking must have been! disgust, and hate,
And terrors manifold divided me
A spoil amongst them. I prepar'd to flee
Into the dungeon core of that wild wood:
I fled three days–when lo! before me stood
Glaring the angry witch. O Dis, even now,570
A clammy dew is beading on my brow,
At mere remembering her pale laugh, and curse.
"Ha! ha! Sir Dainty! there must be a nurse
Made of rose leaves and thistledown, express,
To cradle thee my sweet, and lull thee: yes,
I am too flinty-hard for thy nice touch:
My tenderest squeeze is but a giant's clutch.
So, fairy-thing, it shall have lullabies
Unheard of yet; and it shall still its cries
Upon some breast more lily-feminine.580
Oh, no–it shall not pine, and pine, and pine
More than one pretty, trifling thousand years;
And then 'twere pity, but fate's gentle shears
Cut short its immortality. Sea-flirt!
Young dove of the waters! truly I'll not hurt
One hair of thine: see how I weep and sigh,
That our heart-broken parting is so nigh.
And must we part? Ah, yes, it must be so.
Yet ere thou leavest me in utter woe,
Let me sob over thee my last adieus,590
And speak a blessing: Mark me! Thou hast thews
Immortal, for thou art of heavenly race:
But such a love is mine, that here I chase
Eternally away from thee all bloom
Of youth, and destine thee towards a tomb.
Hence shalt thou quickly to the watery vast;
And there, ere many days be overpast,
Disabled age shall seize thee; and even then
Thou shalt not go the way of aged men;
But live and wither, cripple and still breathe600
Ten hundred years: which gone, I then bequeath
Thy fragile bones to unknown burial.
Adieu, sweet love, adieu!"–As shot stars fall,
She fled ere I could groan for mercy. Stung
And poisoned was my spirit: despair sung
A war-song of defiance 'gainst all hell.
A hand was at my shoulder to compel
My sullen steps; another 'fore my eyes
Moved on with pointed finger. In this guise
Enforced, at the last by ocean's foam610
I found me; by my fresh, my native home.
Its tempering coolness, to my life akin,
Came salutary as I waded in;
And, with a blind voluptuous rage, I gave
Battle to the swollen billow-ridge, and drave
Large froth before me, while there yet remain'd
Hale strength, nor from my bones all marrow drain'd.
"Young lover, I must weep–such hellish spite
With dry cheek who can tell? While thus my might
Proving upon this element, dismay'd,620
Upon a dead thing's face my hand I laid;
I look'd–'twas Scylla! Cursed, cursed Circe!
O vulture-witch, hast never heard of mercy?
Could not thy harshest vengeance be content,
But thou must nip this tender innocent
Because I lov'd her?–Cold, O cold indeed
Were her fair limbs, and like a common weed
The sea-swell took her hair. Dead as she was
I clung about her waist, nor ceas'd to pass
Fleet as an arrow through unfathom'd brine,630
Until there shone a fabric crystalline,
Ribb'd and inlaid with coral, pebble, and pearl.
Headlong I darted; at one eager swirl
Gain'd its bright portal, enter'd, and behold!
'Twas vast, and desolate, and icy-cold;
And all around–But wherefore this to thee
Who in few minutes more thyself shalt see?–
I left poor Scylla in a niche and fled.
My fever'd parchings up, my scathing dread
Met palsy half way: soon these limbs became640
Gaunt, wither'd, sapless, feeble, cramp'd, and lame.
"Now let me pass a cruel, cruel space,
Without one hope, without one faintest trace
Of mitigation, or redeeming bubble
Of colour'd phantasy; for I fear 'twould trouble
Thy brain to loss of reason: and next tell
How a restoring chance came down to quell

One half of the witch in me.

"On a day,
Sitting upon a rock above the spray,650
I saw grow up from the horizon's brink
A gallant vessel: soon she seem'd to sink
Away from me again, as though her course
Had been resum'd in spite of hindering force–
So vanish'd: and not long, before arose
Dark clouds, and muttering of winds morose.
Old Eolus would stifle his mad spleen,
But could not: therefore all the billows green
Toss'd up the silver spume against the clouds.
The tempest came: I saw that vessel's shrouds660
In perilous bustle; while upon the deck
Stood trembling creatures. I beheld the wreck;
The final gulphing; the poor struggling souls:
I heard their cries amid loud thunder-rolls.
O they had all been sav'd but crazed eld
Annull'd my vigorous cravings: and thus quell'd
And curb'd, think on't, O Latmian! did I sit
Writhing with pity, and a cursing fit
Against that hell-born Circe. The crew had gone,
By one and one, to pale oblivion;670
And I was gazing on the surges prone,
With many a scalding tear and many a groan,
When at my feet emerg'd an old man's hand,
Grasping this scroll, and this same slender wand.
I knelt with pain–reached out my hand–had grasp'd
These treasures–touch'd the knuckles–they unclasp'd–
I caught a finger: but the downward weight
O'erpowered me–it sank. Then 'gan abate
The storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst
The comfortable sun. I was athirst680
To search the book, and in the warming air
Parted its dripping leaves with eager care.
Strange matters did it treat of, and drew on
My soul page after page, till well-nigh won
Into forgetfulness; when, stupefied,
I read these words, and read again, and tried
My eyes against the heavens, and read again.
O what a load of misery and pain
Each Atlas-line bore off!–a shine of hope
Came gold around me, cheering me to cope690
Strenuous with hellish tyranny. Attend!
For thou hast brought their promise to an end.
"In the wide sea there lives a forlorn wretch,
Doom'd with enfeebled carcase to outstretch
His loath'd existence through ten centuries,
And then to die alone. Who can devise
A total opposition? No one. So
One million times ocean must ebb and flow,
And he oppressed. Yet he shall not die,
These things accomplish'd:–If he utterly700
Scans all the depths of magic, and expounds
The meanings of all motions, shapes, and sounds;
If he explores all forms and substances
Straight homeward to their symbol-essences;
He shall not die. Moreover, and in chief,
He must pursue this task of joy and grief
Most piously;–all lovers tempest-tost,
And in the savage overwhelming lost,
He shall deposit side by side, until
Time's creeping shall the dreary space fulfil:710
Which done, and all these labours ripened,
A youth, by heavenly power lov'd and led,
Shall stand before him; whom he shall direct
How to consummate all. The youth elect
Must do the thing, or both will be destroy'd."–
"Then," cried the young Endymion, overjoy'd,
"We are twin brothers in this destiny!
Say, I intreat thee, what achievement high
Is, in this restless world, for me reserv'd.
What! if from thee my wandering feet had swerv'd,720
Had we both perish'd?"–"Look!" the sage replied,
"Dost thou not mark a gleaming through the tide,
Of divers brilliances? 'tis the edifice
I told thee of, where lovely Scylla lies;
And where I have enshrined piously
All lovers, whom fell storms have doom'd to die
Throughout my bondage." Thus discoursing, on
They went till unobscur'd the porches shone;
Which hurryingly they gain'd, and enter'd straight.
Sure never since king Neptune held his state730
Was seen such wonder underneath the stars.
Turn to some level plain where haughty Mars
Has legion'd all his battle; and behold
How every soldier, with firm foot, doth hold
His even breast: see, many steeled squares,
And rigid ranks of iron–whence who dares
One step? Imagine further, line by line,
These warrior thousands on the field supine:–
So in that crystal place, in silent rows,
Poor lovers lay at rest from joys and woes.–740
The stranger from the mountains, breathless, trac'd
Such thousands of shut eyes in order plac'd;
Such ranges of white feet, and patient lips
All ruddy,–for here death no blossom nips.
He mark'd their brows and foreheads; saw their hair
Put sleekly on one side with nicest care;
And each one's gentle wrists, with reverence,

Put cross-wise to its heart.

"Let us commence,
Whisper'd the guide, stuttering with joy, even now."750
He spake, and, trembling like an aspen-bough,
Began to tear his scroll in pieces small,
Uttering the while some mumblings funeral.
He tore it into pieces small as snow
That drifts unfeather'd when bleak northerns blow;
And having done it, took his dark blue cloak
And bound it round Endymion: then struck
His wand against the empty air times nine.–
"What more there is to do, young man, is thine:
But first a little patience; first undo760
This tangled thread, and wind it to a clue.
Ah, gentle! 'tis as weak as spider's skein;
And shouldst thou break it–What, is it done so clean?
A power overshadows thee! Oh, brave!
The spite of hell is tumbling to its grave.
Here is a shell; 'tis pearly blank to me,
Nor mark'd with any sign or charactery–
Canst thou read aught? O read for pity's sake!
Olympus! we are safe! Now, Carian, break
This wand against yon lyre on the pedestal."770
'Twas done: and straight with sudden swell and fall
Sweet music breath'd her soul away, and sigh'd
A lullaby to silence.–"Youth! now strew
These minced leaves on me, and passing through
Those files of dead, scatter the same around,
And thou wilt see the issue."–'Mid the sound
Of flutes and viols, ravishing his heart,
Endymion from Glaucus stood apart,
And scatter'd in his face some fragments light.
How lightning-swift the change! a youthful wight780
Smiling beneath a coral diadem,
Out-sparkling sudden like an upturn'd gem,
Appear'd, and, stepping to a beauteous corse,
Kneel'd down beside it, and with tenderest force
Press'd its cold hand, and wept,–and Scylla sigh'd!
Endymion, with quick hand, the charm applied–
The nymph arose: he left them to their joy,
And onward went upon his high employ,
Showering those powerful fragments on the dead.
And, as he pass'd, each lifted up its head,790
As doth a flower at Apollo's touch.
Death felt it to his inwards: 'twas too much:
Death fell a weeping in his charnel-house.
The Latmian persever'd along, and thus
All were re-animated. There arose
A noise of harmony, pulses and throes
Of gladness in the air–while many, who
Had died in mutual arms devout and true,
Sprang to each other madly; and the rest
Felt a high certainty of being blest.800
They gaz'd upon Endymion. Enchantment
Grew drunken, and would have its head and bent.
Delicious symphonies, like airy flowers,
Budded, and swell'd, and, full-blown, shed full showers
Of light, soft, unseen leaves of sounds divine.
The two deliverers tasted a pure wine
Of happiness, from fairy-press ooz'd out.
Speechless they eyed each other, and about
The fair assembly wander'd to and fro,
Distracted with the richest overflow810

Of joy that ever pour'd from heaven.

—"Away!"
Shouted the new born god; "Follow, and pay
Our piety to Neptunus supreme!"–
Then Scylla, blushing sweetly from her dream,
They led on first, bent to her meek surprise,
Though portal columns of a giant size,
Into the vaulted, boundless emerald.
Joyous all follow'd, as the leader call'd,
Down marble steps; pouring as easily820
As hour-glass sand,–and fast, as you might see
Swallows obeying the south summer's call,
Or swans upon a gentle waterfall.
Thus went that beautiful multitude, nor far,
Ere from among some rocks of glittering spar,
Just within ken, they saw descending thick
Another multitude. Whereat more quick
Moved either host. On a wide sand they met,
And of those numbers every eye was wet;
For each their old love found. A murmuring rose,830
Like what was never heard in all the throes
Of wind and waters: 'tis past human wit
To tell; 'tis dizziness to think of it.
This mighty consummation made, the host
Mov'd on for many a league; and gain'd, and lost
Huge sea-marks; vanward swelling in array,
And from the rear diminishing away,–
Till a faint dawn surpris'd them. Glaucus cried,
"Behold! behold, the palace of his pride!
God Neptune's palaces!" With noise increas'd,840
They shoulder'd on towards that brightening cast.
At every onward step proud domes arose
In prospect,–diamond gleams, and golden glows
Of amber 'gainst their faces levelling.
Joyous, and many as the leaves in spring,
Still onward; still the splendour gradual swell'd.
Rich opal domes were seen, on high upheld
By jasper pillars, letting through their shafts
A blush of coral. Copious wonder-draughts
Each gazer drank; and deeper drank more near:850
For what poor mortals fragment up, as mere
As marble was there lavish, to the vast
Of one fair palace, that far far surpass'd,
Even for common bulk, those olden three,
Memphis, and Babylon, and Nineveh.
As large, as bright, as colour'd as the bow
Of Iris, when unfading it doth shew
Beyond a silvery shower, was the arch
Through which this Paphian army took its march,
Into the outer courts of Neptune's state:860
Whence could be seen, direct, a golden gate,
To which the leaders sped; but not half raught
Ere it burst open swift as fairy thought,
And made those dazzled thousands veil their eyes
Like callow eagles at the first sunrise.
Soon with an eagle nativeness their gaze
Ripe from hue-golden swoons took all the blaze,
And then, behold! large Neptune on his throne
Of emerald deep: yet not exalt alone;
At his right hand stood winged Love, and on870
His left sat smiling Beauty's paragon.
Far as the mariner on highest mast
Can see all round upon the calmed vast,
So wide was Neptune's hall: and as the blue
Doth vault the waters, so the waters drew
Their doming curtains, high, magnificent,
Aw'd from the throne aloof;–and when storm-rent
Disclos'd the thunder-gloomings in Jove's air;
But sooth'd as now, flash'd sudden everywhere,
Noiseless, sub-marine cloudlets, glittering880
Death to a human eye: for there did spring
From natural west, and east, and south, and north,
A light as of four sunsets, blazing forth
A gold-green zenith 'bove the Sea-God's head.
Of lucid depth the floor, and far outspread
As breezeless lake, on which the slim canoe
Of feather'd Indian darts about, as through
The delicatest air: air verily,
But for the portraiture of clouds and sky:
This palace floor breath-air,–but for the amaze890
Of deep-seen wonders motionless,–and blaze
Of the dome pomp, reflected in extremes,

Globing a golden sphere.

They stood in dreams
Till Triton blew his horn. The palace rang;
The Nereids danc'd; the Syrens faintly sang;
And the great Sea-King bow'd his dripping head.
Then Love took wing, and from his pinions shed
On all the multitude a nectarous dew.
The ooze-born Goddess beckoned and drew900
Fair Scylla and her guides to conference;
And when they reach'd the throned eminence
She kist the sea-nymph's cheek,–who sat her down
A toying with the doves. Then,–"Mighty crown
And sceptre of this kingdom!" Venus said,
"Thy vows were on a time to Nais paid:
Behold!"–Two copious tear-drops instant fell
From the God's large eyes; he smil'd delectable,
And over Glaucus held his blessing hands.–
"Endymion! Ah! still wandering in the bands910
Of love? Now this is cruel. Since the hour
I met thee in earth's bosom, all my power
Have I put forth to serve thee. What, not yet
Escap'd from dull mortality's harsh net?
A little patience, youth! 'twill not be long,
Or I am skilless quite: an idle tongue,
A humid eye, and steps luxurious,
Where these are new and strange, are ominous.
Aye, I have seen these signs in one of heaven,
When others were all blind; and were I given920
To utter secrets, haply I might say
Some pleasant words:–but Love will have his day.
So wait awhile expectant. Pr'ythee soon,
Even in the passing of thine honey-moon,
Visit my Cytherea: thou wilt find
Cupid well-natured, my Adonis kind;
And pray persuade with thee–Ah, I have done,
All blisses be upon thee, my sweet son!"–
Thus the fair goddess: while Endymion
Knelt to receive those accents halcyon.930
Meantime a glorious revelry began
Before the Water-Monarch. Nectar ran
In courteous fountains to all cups outreach'd;
And plunder'd vines, teeming exhaustless, pleach'd
New growth about each shell and pendent lyre;
The which, in disentangling for their fire,
Pull'd down fresh foliage and coverture
For dainty toying. Cupid, empire-sure,
Flutter'd and laugh'd, and oft-times through the throng
Made a delighted way. Then dance, and song,940
And garlanding grew wild; and pleasure reign'd.
In harmless tendril they each other chain'd,
And strove who should be smother'd deepest in

Fresh crush of leaves.

O 'tis a very sin
For one so weak to venture his poor verse
In such a place as this. O do not curse,
High Muses! let him hurry to the ending.
All suddenly were silent. A soft blending
Of dulcet instruments came charmingly;950

And then a hymn.

"King of the stormy sea!
Brother of Jove, and co-inheritor
Of elements! Eternally before
Thee the waves awful bow. Fast, stubborn rock,
At thy fear'd trident shrinking, doth unlock
Its deep foundations, hissing into foam.
All mountain-rivers lost, in the wide home
Of thy capacious bosom ever flow.
Thou frownest, and old Eolus thy foe960
Skulks to his cavern, 'mid the gruff complaint
Of all his rebel tempests. Dark clouds faint
When, from thy diadem, a silver gleam
Slants over blue dominion. Thy bright team
Gulphs in the morning light, and scuds along
To bring thee nearer to that golden song
Apollo singeth, while his chariot
Waits at the doors of heaven. Thou art not
For scenes like this: an empire stern hast thou;
And it hath furrow'd that large front: yet now,970
As newly come of heaven, dost thou sit
To blend and interknit
Subdued majesty with this glad time.
O shell-borne King sublime!
We lay our hearts before thee evermore–
We sing, and we adore!
"Breathe softly, flutes;
Be tender of your strings, ye soothing lutes;
Nor be the trumpet heard! O vain, O vain;
Not flowers budding in an April rain,980
Nor breath of sleeping dove, nor river's flow,–
No, nor the Eolian twang of Love's own bow,
Can mingle music fit for the soft ear
Of goddess Cytherea!
Yet deign, white Queen of Beauty, thy fair eyes
On our souls' sacrifice.
"Bright-winged Child!
Who has another care when thou hast smil'd?
Unfortunates on earth, we see at last
All death-shadows, and glooms that overcast990
Our spirits, fann'd away by thy light pinions.
O sweetest essence! sweetest of all minions!
God of warm pulses, and dishevell'd hair,
And panting bosoms bare!
Dear unseen light in darkness! eclipser
Of light in light! delicious poisoner!
Thy venom'd goblet will we quaff until
We fill–we fill!

And by thy Mother's lips—"
 		1000
Was heard no more
For clamour, when the golden palace door
Opened again, and from without, in shone
A new magnificence. On oozy throne
Smooth-moving came Oceanus the old,
To take a latest glimpse at his sheep-fold,
Before he went into his quiet cave
To muse for ever–Then a lucid wave,
Scoop'd from its trembling sisters of mid-sea,
Afloat, and pillowing up the majesty
Of Doris, and the Egean seer, her spouse–1010
Next, on a dolphin, clad in laurel boughs,
Theban Amphion leaning on his lute:
His fingers went across it–All were mute
To gaze on Amphitrite, queen of pearls,
And Thetis pearly too.–

The palace whirls
Around giddy Endymion; seeing he
Was there far strayed from mortality.
He could not bear it–shut his eyes in vain;
Imagination gave a dizzier pain.1020
"O I shall die! sweet Venus, be my stay!
Where is my lovely mistress? Well-away!
I die–I hear her voice–I feel my wing–"
At Neptune's feet he sank. A sudden ring
Of Nereids were about him, in kind strife
To usher back his spirit into life:
But still he slept. At last they interwove
Their cradling arms, and purpos'd to convey
Towards a crystal bower far away.
Lo! while slow carried through the pitying crowd,
To his inward senses these words spake aloud;1031
Written in star-light on the dark above:
Dearest Endymion! my entire love!
How have I dwelt in fear of fate: 'tis done–
Immortal bliss for me too hast thou won.
Arise then! for the hen-dove shall not hatch
Her ready eggs, before I'll kissing snatch
Thee into endless heaven. Awake! awake!
The youth at once arose: a placid lake
Came quiet to his eyes; and forest green,1040
Cooler than all the wonders he had seen,
Lull'd with its simple song his fluttering breast.
How happy once again in grassy nest!
ENDYMION.
BOOK IV.

Muse of my native land! loftiest Muse!
O first-born on the mountains! by the hues
Of heaven on the spiritual air begot:
Long didst thou sit alone in northern grot,
While yet our England was a wolfish den;
Before our forests heard the talk of men;
Before the first of Druids was a child;–
Long didst thou sit amid our regions wild
Rapt in a deep prophetic solitude.
There came an eastern voice of solemn mood:–10
Yet wast thou patient. Then sang forth the Nine,
Apollo's garland:–yet didst thou divine
Such home-bred glory, that they cry'd in vain,
"Come hither, Sister of the Island!" Plain
Spake fair Ausonia; and once more she spake
A higher summons:–still didst thou betake
Thee to thy native hopes. O thou hast won
A full accomplishment! The thing is done,
Which undone, these our latter days had risen
On barren souls. Great Muse, thou know'st what prison,
Of flesh and bone, curbs, and confines, and frets21
Our spirit's wings: despondency besets
Our pillows; and the fresh to-morrow morn
Seems to give forth its light in very scorn
Of our dull, uninspired, snail-paced lives.
Long have I said, how happy he who shrives
To thee! But then I thought on poets gone,
And could not pray:–nor can I now–so on
I move to the end in lowliness of heart.–
"Ah, woe is me! that I should fondly part30
From my dear native land! Ah, foolish maid!
Glad was the hour, when, with thee, myriads bade
Adieu to Ganges and their pleasant fields!
To one so friendless the clear freshet yields
A bitter coolness; the ripe grape is sour:
Yet I would have, great gods! but one short hour
Of native air–let me but die at home."
Endymion to heaven's airy dome
Was offering up a hecatomb of vows,
When these words reach'd him. Whereupon he bows
His head through thorny-green entanglement41
Of underwood, and to the sound is bent,
Anxious as hind towards her hidden fawn.
"Is no one near to help me? No fair dawn
Of life from charitable voice? No sweet saying
To set my dull and sadden'd spirit playing?
No hand to toy with mine? No lips so sweet
That I may worship them? No eyelids meet
To twinkle on my bosom? No one dies
Before me, till from these enslaving eyes50
Redemption sparkles!–I am sad and lost."
Thou, Carian lord, hadst better have been tost
Into a whirlpool. Vanish into air,
Warm mountaineer! for canst thou only bear
A woman's sigh alone and in distress?
See not her charms! Is Phœbe passionless?
Phœbe is fairer far–O gaze no more:–
Yet if thou wilt behold all beauty's store,
Behold her panting in the forest grass!
Do not those curls of glossy jet surpass60
For tenderness the arms so idly lain
Amongst them? Feelest not a kindred pain,
To see such lovely eyes in swimming search
After some warm delight, that seems to perch
Dovelike in the dim cell lying beyond

Their upper lids?–Hist!

"O for Hermes' wand,
To touch this flower into human shape!
That woodland Hyacinthus could escape
From his green prison, and here kneeling down70
Call me his queen, his second life's fair crown!
Ah me, how I could love!–My soul doth melt
For the unhappy youth–Love! I have felt
So faint a kindness, such a meek surrender
To what my own full thoughts had made too tender,
That but for tears my life had fled away!–
Ye deaf and senseless minutes of the day,
And thou, old forest, hold ye this for true,
There is no lightning, no authentic dew
But in the eye of love: there's not a sound,80
Melodious howsoever, can confound
The heavens and earth in one to such a death
As doth the voice of love: there's not a breath
Will mingle kindly with the meadow air,
Till it has panted round, and stolen a share
Of passion from the heart!"–

Upon a bough
He leant, wretched. He surely cannot now
Thirst for another love: O impious,
That he can even dream upon it thus!–90
Thought he, "Why am I not as are the dead,
Since to a woe like this I have been led
Through the dark earth, and through the wondrous sea?
Goddess! I love thee not the less: from thee
By Juno's smile I turn not–no, no, no–
While the great waters are at ebb and flow.–
I have a triple soul! O fond pretence–
For both, for both my love is so immense,
I feel my heart is cut in twain for them."
And so he groan'd, as one by beauty slain.100
The lady's heart beat quick, and he could see
Her gentle bosom heave tumultuously.
He sprang from his green covert: there she lay,
Sweet as a muskrose upon new-made hay;
With all her limbs on tremble, and her eyes
Shut softly up alive. To speak he tries.
"Fair damsel, pity me! forgive that I
Thus violate thy bower's sanctity!
O pardon me, for I am full of grief–
Grief born of thee, young angel! fairest thief!110
Who stolen hast away the wings wherewith
I was to top the heavens. Dear maid, sith
Thou art my executioner, and I feel
Loving and hatred, misery and weal,
Will in a few short hours be nothing to me,
And all my story that much passion slew me;
Do smile upon the evening of my days:
And, for my tortur'd brain begins to craze,
Be thou my nurse; and let me understand
How dying I shall kiss that lily hand.–120
Dost weep for me? Then should I be content.
Scowl on, ye fates! until the firmament
Outblackens Erebus, and the full-cavern'd earth
Crumbles into itself. By the cloud girth
Of Jove, those tears have given me a thirst
To meet oblivion."–As her heart would burst
The maiden sobb'd awhile, and then replied:
"Why must such desolation betide
As that thou speakest of? Are not these green nooks
Empty of all misfortune? Do the brooks130
Utter a gorgon voice? Does yonder thrush,
Schooling its half-fledg'd little ones to brush
About the dewy forest, whisper tales?–
Speak not of grief, young stranger, or cold snails
Will slime the rose to night. Though if thou wilt,
Methinks 'twould be a guilt–a very guilt–
Not to companion thee, and sigh away
The light–the dusk–the dark–till break of day!"
"Dear lady," said Endymion, "'tis past:
I love thee! and my days can never last.140
That I may pass in patience still speak:
Let me have music dying, and I seek
No more delight–I bid adieu to all.
Didst thou not after other climates call,
And murmur about Indian streams?"–Then she,
Sitting beneath the midmost forest tree,
For pity sang this roundelay—
"O Sorrow,
Why dost borrow
The natural hue of health, from vermeil lips?–150
To give maiden blushes
To the white rose bushes?
Or is it thy dewy hand the daisy tips?
"O Sorrow,
Why dost borrow
The lustrous passion from a falcon-eye?–
To give the glow-worm light?
Or, on a moonless night,
To tinge, on syren shores, the salt sea-spry?
"O Sorrow,160
Why dost borrow
The mellow ditties from a mourning tongue?–
To give at evening pale
Unto the nightingale,
That thou mayst listen the cold dews among?
"O Sorrow,
Why dost borrow
Heart's lightness from the merriment of May?–
A lover would not tread
A cowslip on the head,170
Though he should dance from eve till peep of day–
Nor any drooping flower
Held sacred for thy bower,
Wherever he may sport himself and play.
"To Sorrow,
I bade good-morrow,
And thought to leave her far away behind;
But cheerly, cheerly,
She loves me dearly;
She is so constant to me, and so kind:180
I would deceive her
And so leave her,
But ah! she is so constant and so kind.
"Beneath my palm trees, by the river side,
I sat a weeping: in the whole world wide
There was no one to ask me why I wept,–
And so I kept
Brimming the water-lily cups with tears
Cold as my fears.
"Beneath my palm trees, by the river side,190
I sat a weeping: what enamour'd bride,
Cheated by shadowy wooer from the clouds,
But hides and shrouds
Beneath dark palm trees by a river side?
"And as I sat, over the light blue hills
There came a noise of revellers: the rills
Into the wide stream came of purple hue–
'Twas Bacchus and his crew!
The earnest trumpet spake, and silver thrills
From kissing cymbals made a merry din–200
'Twas Bacchus and his kin!
Like to a moving vintage down they came,
Crown'd with green leaves, and faces all on flame;
All madly dancing through the pleasant valley,
To scare thee, Melancholy!
O then, O then, thou wast a simple name!
And I forgot thee, as the berried holly
By shepherds is forgotten, when, in June,
Tall chesnuts keep away the sun and moon:–
I rush'd into the folly!210
"Within his car, aloft, young Bacchus stood,
Trifling his ivy-dart, in dancing mood,
With sidelong laughing;
And little rills of crimson wine imbrued
His plump white arms, and shoulders, enough white
For Venus' pearly bite:
And near him rode Silenus on his ass,
Pelted with flowers as he on did pass
Tipsily quaffing.
"Whence came ye, merry Damsels! whence came ye!
So many, and so many, and such glee?221
Why have ye left your bowers desolate,
Your lutes, and gentler fate?–
'We follow Bacchus! Bacchus on the wing,
A conquering!
Bacchus, young Bacchus! good or ill betide,
We dance before him thorough kingdoms wide:–
Come hither, lady fair, and joined be
To our wild minstrelsy!'
"Whence came ye, jolly Satyrs! whence came ye!230
So many, and so many, and such glee?
Why have ye left your forest haunts, why left
Your nuts in oak-tree cleft?–
'For wine, for wine we left our kernel tree;
For wine we left our heath, and yellow brooms,
And cold mushrooms;
For wine we follow Bacchus through the earth;
Great God of breathless cups and chirping mirth!–
Come hither, lady fair, and joined be
To our mad minstrelsy!'240
"Over wide streams and mountains great we went,
And, save when Bacchus kept his ivy tent,
Onward the tiger and the leopard pants,
With Asian elephants:
Onward these myriads–with song and dance,
With zebras striped, and sleek Arabians' prance,
Web-footed alligators, crocodiles,
Bearing upon their scaly backs, in files,
Plump infant laughers mimicking the coil
Of seamen, and stout galley-rowers' toil:250
With toying oars and silken sails they glide,
Nor care for wind and tide.
"Mounted on panthers' furs and lions' manes,
From rear to van they scour about the plains;
A three days' journey in a moment done:
And always, at the rising of the sun,
About the wilds they hunt with spear and horn,
On spleenful unicorn.
"I saw Osirian Egypt kneel adown
Before the vine-wreath crown!260
I saw parch'd Abyssinia rouse and sing
To the silver cymbals' ring!
I saw the whelming vintage hotly pierce
Old Tartary the fierce!
The kings of Inde their jewel-sceptres vail,
And from their treasures scatter pearled hail;
Great Brahma from his mystic heaven groans,
And all his priesthood moans;
Before young Bacchus' eye-wink turning pale.–
Into these regions came I following him,270
Sick hearted, weary–so I took a whim
To stray away into these forests drear
Alone, without a peer:
And I have told thee all thou mayest hear.
"Young stranger!
I've been a ranger
In search of pleasure throughout every clime:
Alas, 'tis not for me!
Bewitch'd I sure must be,
To lose in grieving all my maiden prime.280
"Come then, Sorrow!
Sweetest Sorrow!
Like an own babe I nurse thee on my breast:
I thought to leave thee
And deceive thee,
But now of all the world I love thee best.
"There is not one,
No, no, not one
But thee to comfort a poor lonely maid;
Thou art her mother,290
And her brother,
Her playmate, and her wooer in the shade."
O what a sigh she gave in finishing,
And look, quite dead to every worldly thing!
Endymion could not speak, but gazed on her;
And listened to the wind that now did stir
About the crisped oaks full drearily,
Yet with as sweet a softness as might be
Remember'd from its velvet summer song.
At last he said: "Poor lady, how thus long300
Have I been able to endure that voice?
Fair Melody! kind Syren! I've no choice;
I must be thy sad servant evermore:
I cannot choose but kneel here and adore.
Alas, I must not think–by Phœbe, no!
Let me not think, soft Angel! shall it be so?
Say, beautifullest, shall I never think?
O thou could'st foster me beyond the brink
Of recollection! make my watchful care
Close up its bloodshot eyes, nor see despair!310
Do gently murder half my soul, and I
Shall feel the other half so utterly!–
I'm giddy at that cheek so fair and smooth;
O let it blush so ever! let it soothe
My madness! let it mantle rosy-warm
With the tinge of love, panting in safe alarm.–
This cannot be thy hand, and yet it is;
And this is sure thine other softling–this
Thine own fair bosom, and I am so near!
Wilt fall asleep? O let me sip that tear!320
And whisper one sweet word that I may know
This is this world–sweet dewy blossom!"–Woe!
Woe! Woe to that Endymion! Where is he?–
Even these words went echoing dismally
Through the wide forest–a most fearful tone,
Like one repenting in his latest moan;
And while it died away a shade pass'd by,
As of a thunder cloud. When arrows fly
Through the thick branches, poor ring-doves sleek forth
Their timid necks and tremble; so these both330
Leant to each other trembling, and sat so
Waiting for some destruction–when lo,
Foot-feather'd Mercury appear'd sublime
Beyond the tall tree tops; and in less time
Than shoots the slanted hail-storm, down he dropt
Towards the ground; but rested not, nor stopt
One moment from his home: only the sward
He with his wand light touch'd, and heavenward
Swifter than sight was gone–even before
The teeming earth a sudden witness bore340
Of his swift magic. Diving swans appear
Above the crystal circlings white and clear;
And catch the cheated eye in wild surprise,
How they can dive in sight and unseen rise–
So from the turf outsprang two steeds jet-black,
Each with large dark blue wings upon his back.
The youth of Caria plac'd the lovely dame
On one, and felt himself in spleen to tame
The other's fierceness. Through the air they flew,
High as the eagles. Like two drops of dew350
Exhal'd to Phœbus' lips, away they are gone,
Far from the earth away–unseen, alone,
Among cool clouds and winds, but that the free,
The buoyant life of song can floating be
Above their heads, and follow them untir'd.–
Muse of my native land, am I inspir'd?
This is the giddy air, and I must spread
Wide pinions to keep here; nor do I dread
Or height, or depth, or width, or any chance
Precipitous: I have beneath my glance360
Those towering horses and their mournful freight.
Could I thus sail, and see, and thus await
Fearless for power of thought, without thine aid?–
There is a sleepy dusk, an odorous shade
From some approaching wonder, and behold
Those winged steeds, with snorting nostrils bold
Snuff at its faint extreme, and seem to tire,
Dying to embers from their native fire!
There curl'd a purple mist around them; soon,
It seem'd as when around the pale new moon370
Sad Zephyr droops the clouds like weeping willow:
'Twas Sleep slow journeying with head on pillow.
For the first time, since he came nigh dead born
From the old womb of night, his cave forlorn
Had he left more forlorn; for the first time,
He felt aloof the day and morning's prime–
Because into his depth Cimmerian
There came a dream, shewing how a young man,
Ere a lean bat could plump its wintery skin,
Would at high Jove's empyreal footstool win380
An immortality, and how espouse
Jove's daughter, and be reckon'd of his house.
Now was he slumbering towards heaven's gate,
That he might at the threshold one hour wait
To hear the marriage melodies, and then
Sink downward to his dusky cave again.
His litter of smooth semilucent mist,
Diversely ting'd with rose and amethyst,
Puzzled those eyes that for the centre sought;
And scarcely for one moment could be caught390
His sluggish form reposing motionless.
Those two on winged steeds, with all the stress
Of vision search'd for him, as one would look
Athwart the sallows of a river nook
To catch a glance at silver throated eels,–
Or from old Skiddaw's top, when fog conceals
His rugged forehead in a mantle pale,
With an eye-guess towards some pleasant vale
Descry a favourite hamlet faint and far.
These raven horses, though they foster'd are400
Of earth's splenetic fire, dully drop
Their full-veined ears, nostrils blood wide, and stop;
Upon the spiritless mist have they outspread
Their ample feathers, are in slumber dead,–
And on those pinions, level in mid air,
Endymion sleepeth and the lady fair.
Slowly they sail, slowly as icy isle
Upon a calm sea drifting: and meanwhile
The mournful wanderer dreams. Behold! he walks
On heaven's pavement; brotherly he talks410
To divine powers: from his hand full fain
Juno's proud birds are pecking pearly grain:
He tries the nerve of Phœbus' golden bow,
And asketh where the golden apples grow:
Upon his arm he braces Pallas' shield,
And strives in vain to unsettle and wield
A Jovian thunderbolt: arch Hebe brings
A full-brimm'd goblet, dances lightly, sings
And tantalizes long; at last he drinks,
And lost in pleasure at her feet he sinks,420
Touching with dazzled lips her starlight hand.
He blows a bugle,–an ethereal band
Are visible above: the Seasons four,–
Green-kyrtled Spring, flush Summer, golden store
In Autumn's sickle, Winter frosty hoar,
Join dance with shadowy Hours; while still the blast,
In swells unmitigated, still doth last
To sway their floating morris. "Whose is this?
Whose bugle?" he inquires: they smile–"O Dis!
Why is this mortal here? Dost thou not know430
Its mistress' lips? Not thou?–'Tis Dian's: lo!
She rises crescented!" He looks, 'tis she,
His very goddess: good-bye earth, and sea,
And air, and pains, and care, and suffering;
Good-bye to all but love! Then doth he spring
Towards her, and awakes–and, strange, o'erhead,
Of those same fragrant exhalations bred,
Beheld awake his very dream: the gods
Stood smiling; merry Hebe laughs and nods;
And Phœbe bends towards him crescented.440
O state perplexing! On the pinion bed,
Too well awake, he feels the panting side
Of his delicious lady. He who died
For soaring too audacious in the sun,
Where that same treacherous wax began to run,
Felt not more tongue-tied than Endymion.
His heart leapt up as to its rightful throne,
To that fair shadow'd passion puls'd its way–
Ah, what perplexity! Ah, well a day!
So fond, so beauteous was his bed-fellow,450
He could not help but kiss her: then he grew
Awhile forgetful of all beauty save
Young Phœbe's, golden hair'd; and so 'gan crave
Forgiveness: yet he turn'd once more to look
At the sweet sleeper,–all his soul was shook,–
She press'd his hand in slumber; so once more
He could not help but kiss her and adore.
At this the shadow wept, melting away.
The Latmian started up: "Bright goddess, stay!
Search my most hidden breast! By truth's own tongue,
I have no dædale heart: why is it wrung461
To desperation? Is there nought for me,
Upon the bourne of bliss, but misery?"
These words awoke the stranger of dark tresses:
Her dawning love-look rapt Endymion blesses
With 'haviour soft. Sleep yawned from underneath.
"Thou swan of Ganges, let us no more breathe
This murky phantasm! thou contented seem'st
Pillow'd in lovely idleness, nor dream'st
What horrors may discomfort thee and me.470
Ah, shouldst thou die from my heart-treachery!–
Yet did she merely weep–her gentle soul
Hath no revenge in it: as it is whole
In tenderness, would I were whole in love!
Can I prize thee, fair maid, till price above,
Even when I feel as true as innocence?
I do, I do.–What is this soul then? Whence
Came it? It does not seem my own, and I
Have no self-passion or identity.
Some fearful end must be: where, where is it?480
By Nemesis, I see my spirit flit
Alone about the dark–Forgive me, sweet:
Shall we away?" He rous'd the steeds: they beat
Their wings chivalrous into the clear air,
Leaving old Sleep within his vapoury lair.
The good-night blush of eve was waning slow,
And Vesper, risen star, began to throe
In the dusk heavens silvery, when they
Thus sprang direct towards the Galaxy.
Nor did speed hinder converse soft and strange–490
Eternal oaths and vows they interchange,
In such wise, in such temper, so aloof
Up in the winds, beneath a starry roof,
So witless of their doom, that verily
'Tis well nigh past man's search their hearts to see;
Whether they wept, or laugh'd, or griev'd, or toy'd–
Most like with joy gone mad, with sorrow cloy'd.
Fell facing their swift flight, from ebon streak,
The moon put forth a little diamond peak,
No bigger than an unobserved star,500
Or tiny point of fairy scymetar;
Bright signal that she only stoop'd to tie
Her silver sandals, ere deliciously
She bow'd into the heavens her timid head.
Slowly she rose, as though she would have fled,
While to his lady meek the Carian turn'd,
To mark if her dark eyes had yet discern'd
This beauty in its birth–Despair! despair!
He saw her body fading gaunt and spare
In the cold moonshine. Straight he seiz'd her wrist;
It melted from his grasp: her hand he kiss'd,511
And, horror! kiss'd his own–he was alone.
Her steed a little higher soar'd, and then

Dropt hawkwise to the earth.

There lies a den,
Beyond the seeming confines of the space
Made for the soul to wander in and trace
Its own existence, of remotest glooms.
Dark regions are around it, where the tombs
Of buried griefs the spirit sees, but scarce520
One hour doth linger weeping, for the pierce
Of new-born woe it feels more inly smart:
And in these regions many a venom'd dart
At random flies; they are the proper home
Of every ill: the man is yet to come
Who hath not journeyed in this native hell.
But few have ever felt how calm and well
Sleep may be had in that deep den of all.
There anguish does not sting; nor pleasure pall:
Woe-hurricanes beat ever at the gate,530
Yet all is still within and desolate.
Beset with plainful gusts, within ye hear
No sound so loud as when on curtain'd bier
The death-watch tick is stifled. Enter none
Who strive therefore: on the sudden it is won.
Just when the sufferer begins to burn,
Then it is free to him; and from an urn,
Still fed by melting ice, he takes a draught–
Young Semele such richness never quaft
In her maternal longing. Happy gloom!540
Dark Paradise! where pale becomes the bloom
Of health by due; where silence dreariest
Is most articulate; where hopes infest;
Where those eyes are the brightest far that keep
Their lids shut longest in a dreamless sleep.
O happy spirit-home! O wondrous soul!
Pregnant with such a den to save the whole
In thine own depth. Hail, gentle Carian!
For, never since thy griefs and woes began,
Hast thou felt so content: a grievous feud550
Hath let thee to this Cave of Quietude.
Aye, his lull'd soul was there, although upborne
With dangerous speed: and so he did not mourn
Because he knew not whither he was going.
So happy was he, not the aerial blowing
Of trumpets at clear parley from the east
Could rouse from that fine relish, that high feast.
They stung the feather'd horse: with fierce alarm
He flapp'd towards the sound. Alas, no charm
Could lift Endymion's head, or he had view'd560
A skyey mask, a pinion'd multitude,–
And silvery was its passing: voices sweet
Warbling the while as if to lull and greet
The wanderer in his path. Thus warbled they,
While past the vision went in bright array.
"Who, who from Dian's feast would be away?
For all the golden bowers of the day
Are empty left? Who, who away would be
From Cynthia's wedding and festivity?
Not Hesperus: lo! upon his silver wings570
He leans away for highest heaven and sings,
Snapping his lucid fingers merrily!–
Ah, Zephyrus! art here, and Flora too!
Ye tender bibbers of the rain and dew,
Young playmates of the rose and daffodil,
Be careful, ere ye enter in, to fill
Your baskets high
With fennel green, and balm, and golden pines,
Savory, latter-mint, and columbines,
Cool parsley, basil sweet, and sunny thyme;580
Yea, every flower and leaf of every clime,
All gather'd in the dewy morning: hie
Away! fly, fly!–
Crystalline brother of the belt of heaven,
Aquarius! to whom king Jove has given
Two liquid pulse streams 'stead of feather'd wings,
Two fan-like fountains,–thine illuminings
For Dian play:
Dissolve the frozen purity of air;
Let thy white shoulders silvery and bare590
Shew cold through watery pinions; make more bright
The Star-Queen's crescent on her marriage night:
Haste, haste away!–
Castor has tamed the planet Lion, see!
And of the Bear has Pollux mastery:
A third is in the race! who is the third,
Speeding away swift as the eagle bird?
The ramping Centaur!
The Lion's mane's on end: the Bear how fierce!
The Centaur's arrow ready seems to pierce600
Some enemy: far forth his bow is bent
Into the blue of heaven. He'll be shent,
Pale unrelentor,
When he shall hear the wedding lutes a playing.–
Andromeda! sweet woman! why delaying
So timidly among the stars: come hither!
Join this bright throng, and nimbly follow whither
They all are going.
Danae's Son, before Jove newly bow'd,
Has wept for thee, calling to Jove aloud.610
Thee, gentle lady, did he disenthral:
Ye shall for ever live and love, for all
Thy tears are flowing.–

By Daphne's fright, behold Apollo!–"

More
Endymion heard not: down his steed him bore,
Prone to the green head of a misty hill.
His first touch of the earth went nigh to kill.
"Alas!" said he, "were I but always borne
Through dangerous winds, had but my footsteps worn
A path in hell, for ever would I bless621
Horrors which nourish an uneasiness
For my own sullen conquering: to him
Who lives beyond earth's boundary, grief is dim,
Sorrow is but a shadow: now I see
The grass; I feel the solid ground–Ah, me!
It is thy voice–divinest! Where?–who? who
Left thee so quiet on this bed of dew?
Behold upon this happy earth we are;
Let us ay love each other; let us fare630
On forest-fruits, and never, never go
Among the abodes of mortals here below,
Or be by phantoms duped. O destiny!
Into a labyrinth now my soul would fly,
But with thy beauty will I deaden it.
Where didst thou melt too? By thee will I sit
For ever: let our fate stop here–a kid
I on this spot will offer: Pan will bid
Us live in peace, in love and peace among
His forest wildernesses. I have clung640
To nothing, lov'd a nothing, nothing seen
Or felt but a great dream! O I have been
Presumptuous against love, against the sky,
Against all elements, against the tie
Of mortals each to each, against the blooms
Of flowers, rush of rivers, and the tombs
Of heroes gone! Against his proper glory
Has my own soul conspired: so my story
Will I to children utter, and repent.
There never liv'd a mortal man, who bent650
His appetite beyond his natural sphere,
But starv'd and died. My sweetest Indian, here,
Here will I kneel, for thou redeemed hast
My life from too thin breathing: gone and past
Are cloudy phantasms. Caverns lone, farewel!
And air of visions, and the monstrous swell
Of visionary seas! No, never more
Shall airy voices cheat me to the shore
Of tangled wonder, breathless and aghast.
Adieu, my daintiest Dream! although so vast660
My love is still for thee. The hour may come
When we shall meet in pure elysium.
On earth I may not love thee; and therefore
Doves will I offer up, and sweetest store
All through the teeming year: so thou wilt shine
On me, and on this damsel fair of mine,
And bless our simple lives. My Indian bliss!
My river-lily bud! one human kiss!
One sigh of real breath–one gentle squeeze,
Warm as a dove's nest among summer trees,670
And warm with dew at ooze from living blood!
Whither didst melt? Ah, what of that!–all good
We'll talk about–no more of dreaming.–Now,
Where shall our dwelling be? Under the brow
Of some steep mossy hill, where ivy dun
Would hide us up, although spring leaves were none;
And where dark yew trees, as we rustle through,
Will drop their scarlet berry cups of dew?
O thou wouldst joy to live in such a place;
Dusk for our loves, yet light enough to grace680
Those gentle limbs on mossy bed reclin'd:
For by one step the blue sky shouldst thou find,
And by another, in deep dell below,
See, through the trees, a little river go
All in its mid-day gold and glimmering.
Honey from out the gnarled hive I'll bring,
And apples, wan with sweetness, gather thee,–
Cresses that grow where no man may them see,
And sorrel untorn by the dew-claw'd stag:
Pipes will I fashion of the syrinx flag,690
That thou mayst always know whither I roam,
When it shall please thee in our quiet home
To listen and think of love. Still let me speak;
Still let me dive into the joy I seek,–
For yet the past doth prison me. The rill,
Thou haply mayst delight in, will I fill
With fairy fishes from the mountain tarn,
And thou shall feed them from the squirrel's barn.
Its bottom will I strew with amber shells,
And pebbles blue from deep enchanted wells.700
Its sides I'll plant with dew-sweet eglantine,
And honeysuckles full of clear bee-wine.
I will entice this crystal rill to trace
Love's silver name upon the meadow's face.
I'll kneel to Vesta, for a flame of fire;
And to god Phœbus, for a golden lyre;
To Empress Dian, for a hunting spear;
To Vesper, for a taper silver-clear,
That I may see thy beauty through the night;
To Flora, and a nightingale shall light710
Tame on thy finger; to the River-gods,
And they shall bring thee taper fishing-rods
Of gold, and lines of Naiads' long bright tress.
Heaven shield thee for thine utter loveliness!
Thy mossy footstool shall the altar be
'Fore which I'll bend, bending, dear love, to thee:
Those lips shall be my Delphos, and shall speak
Laws to my footsteps, colour to my cheek,
Trembling or stedfastness to this same voice,
And of three sweetest pleasurings the choice:720
And that affectionate light, those diamond things,
Those eyes, those passions, those supreme pearl springs,
Shall be my grief, or twinkle me to pleasure.
Say, is not bliss within our perfect seisure?

O that I could not doubt?"

The mountaineer
Thus strove by fancies vain and crude to clear
His briar'd path to some tranquillity.
It gave bright gladness to his lady's eye,
And yet the tears she wept were tears of sorrow;730
Answering thus, just as the golden morrow
Beam'd upward from the vallies of the east:
"O that the flutter of this heart had ceas'd,
Or the sweet name of love had pass'd away.
Young feathor'd tyrant! by a swift decay
Wilt thou devote this body to the earth:
And I do think that at my very birth
I lisp'd thy blooming titles inwardly;
For at the first, first dawn and thought of thee,
With uplift hands I blest the stars of heaven.740
Art thou not cruel? Ever have I striven
To think thee kind, but ah, it will not do!
When yet a child, I heard that kisses drew
Favour from thee, and so I gave and gave
To the void air, bidding them find out love:
But when I came to feel how far above
All fancy, pride, and fickle maidenhood,
All earthly pleasure, all imagin'd good,
Was the warm tremble of a devout kiss,–
Even then, that moment, at the thought of this,750
Fainting I fell into a bed of flowers,
And languish'd there three days. Ye milder powers,
Am I not cruelly wrong'd? Believe, believe
Me, dear Endymion, were I to weave
With my own fancies garlands of sweet life,
Thou shouldst be one of all. Ah, bitter strife!
I may not be thy love: I am forbidden–
Indeed I am–thwarted, affrighted, chidden,
By things I trembled at, and gorgon wrath.
Twice hast thou ask'd whither I went: henceforth760
Ask me no more! I may not utter it,
Nor may I be thy love. We might commit
Ourselves at once to vengeance; we might die;
We might embrace and die: voluptuous thought!
Enlarge not to my hunger, or I'm caught
In trammels of perverse deliciousness.
No, no, that shall not be: thee will I bless,
And bid a long adieu."

The Carian
No word return'd: both lovelorn, silent, wan,770
Into the vallies green together went.
Far wandering, they were perforce content
To sit beneath a fair lone beechen tree;
Nor at each other gaz'd, but heavily
Por'd on its hazle cirque of shedded leaves.
Endymion! unhappy! it nigh grieves
Me to behold thee thus in last extreme:
Ensky'd ere this, but truly that I deem
Truth the best music in a first-born song.
Thy lute-voic'd brother will I sing ere long,780
And thou shall aid–hast thou not aided me?
Yes, moonlight Emperor! felicity
Has been thy meed for many thousand years;
Yet often have I, on the brink of tears,
Mourn'd as if yet thou wert a forester;–

Forgetting the old tale.

He did not stir
His eyes from the dead leaves, or one small pulse
Of joy he might have felt. The spirit culls
Unfaded amaranth, when wild it strays790
Through the old garden-ground of boyish days.
A little onward ran the very stream
By which he took his first soft poppy dream;
And on the very bark 'gainst which he leant
A crescent he had carv'd, and round it spent
His skill in little stars. The teeming tree
Had swollen and green'd the pious charactery,
But not ta'en out. Why, there was not a slope
Up which he had not fear'd the antelope;
And not a tree, beneath whose rooty shade800
He had not with his tamed leopards play'd;
Nor could an arrow light, or javelin,
Fly in the air where his had never been–
And yet he knew it not.

O treachery!
Why does his lady smile, pleasing her eye
With all his sorrowing? He sees her not.
But who so stares on him? His sister sure!
Peona of the woods!–Can she endure–
Impossible–how dearly they embrace!810
His lady smiles; delight is in her face;
It is no treachery.

"Dear brother mine!
Endymion, weep not so! Why shouldst thou pine
When all great Latmos so exalt will be?
Thank the great gods, and look not bitterly;
And speak not one pale word, and sigh no more.
Sure I will not believe thou hast such store
Of grief, to last thee to my kiss again.
Thou surely canst not bear a mind in pain,820
Come hand in hand with one so beautiful.
Be happy both of you! for I will pull
The flowers of autumn for your coronals.
Pan's holy priest for young Endymion calls;
And when he is restor'd, thou, fairest dame,
Shalt be our queen. Now, is it not a shame
To see ye thus,–not very, very sad?
Perhaps ye are too happy to be glad:
O feel as if it were a common day;
Free-voic'd as one who never was away.830
No tongue shall ask, whence come ye? but ye shall
Be gods of your own rest imperial.
Not even I, for one whole month, will pry
Into the hours that have pass'd us by,
Since in my arbour I did sing to thee.
O Hermes! on this very night will be
A hymning up to Cynthia, queen of light;
For the soothsayers old saw yesternight
Good visions in the air,–whence will befal,
As say these sages, health perpetual840
To shepherds and their flocks; and furthermore,
In Dian's face they read the gentle lore:
Therefore for her these vesper-carols are.
Our friends will all be there from nigh and far.
Many upon thy death have ditties made;
And many, even now, their foreheads shade
With cypress, on a day of sacrifice.
New singing for our maids shalt thou devise,
And pluck the sorrow from our huntsmen's brows.
Tell me, my lady-queen, how to espouse850
This wayward brother to his rightful joys!
His eyes are on thee bent, as thou didst poise
His fate most goddess-like. Help me, I pray,
To lure–Endymion, dear brother, say
What ails thee?" He could bear no more, and so
Bent his soul fiercely like a spiritual bow,
And twang'd it inwardly, and calmly said:
"I would have thee my only friend, sweet maid!
My only visitor! not ignorant though,
That those deceptions which for pleasure go860
'Mong men, are pleasures real as real may be:
But there are higher ones I may not see,
If impiously an earthly realm I take.
Since I saw thee, I have been wide awake
Night after night, and day by day, until
Of the empyrean I have drunk my fill.
Let it content thee, Sister, seeing me
More happy than betides mortality.
A hermit young, I'll live in mossy cave,
Where thou alone shalt come to me, and lave870
Thy spirit in the wonders I shall tell.
Through me the shepherd realm shall prosper well;
For to thy tongue will I all health confide.
And, for my sake, let this young maid abide
With thee as a dear sister. Thou alone,
Peona, mayst return to me. I own
This may sound strangely: but when, dearest girl,
Thou seest it for my happiness, no pearl
Will trespass down those cheeks. Companion fair!
Wilt be content to dwell with her, to share880
This sister's love with me?" Like one resign'd
And bent by circumstance, and thereby blind
In self-commitment, thus that meek unknown:
"Aye, but a buzzing by my ears has flown,
Of jubilee to Dian:–truth I heard!
Well then, I see there is no little bird,
Tender soever, but is Jove's own care.
Long have I sought for rest, and, unaware,
Behold I find it! so exalted too!
So after my own heart! I knew, I knew890
There was a place untenanted in it:
In that same void white Chastity shall sit,
And monitor me nightly to lone slumber.
With sanest lips I vow me to the number
Of Dian's sisterhood; and, kind lady,
With thy good help, this very night shall see
My future days to her fane consecrate."
As feels a dreamer what doth most create
His own particular fright, so these three felt:
Or like one who, in after ages, knelt900
To Lucifer or Baal, when he'd pine
After a little sleep: or when in mine
Far under-ground, a sleeper meets his friends
Who know him not. Each diligently bends
Towards common thoughts and things for very fear;
Striving their ghastly malady to cheer,
By thinking it a thing of yes and no,
That housewives talk of. But the spirit-blow
Was struck, and all were dreamers. At the last
Endymion said: "Are not our fates all cast?910
Why stand we here? Adieu, ye tender pair!
Adieu!" Whereat those maidens, with wild stare,
Walk'd dizzily away. Pained and hot
His eyes went after them, until they got
Near to a cypress grove, whose deadly maw,
In one swift moment, would what then he saw
Engulph for ever. "Stay!" he cried, "ah, stay!
Turn, damsels! hist! one word I have to say.
Sweet Indian, I would see thee once again.
It is a thing I dote on: so I'd fain,920
Peona, ye should hand in hand repair
Into those holy groves, that silent are
Behind great Dian's temple. I'll be yon,
At vesper's earliest twinkle–they are gone–
But once, once, once again–" At this he press'd
His hands against his face, and then did rest
His head upon a mossy hillock green,
And so remain'd as he a corpse had been
All the long day; save when he scantly lifted
His eyes abroad, to see how shadows shifted930
With the slow move of time,–sluggish and weary
Until the poplar tops, in journey dreary,
Had reach'd the river's brim. Then up he rose,
And, slowly as that very river flows,
Walk'd towards the temple grove with this lament:
"Why such a golden eve? The breeze is sent
Careful and soft, that not a leaf may fall
Before the serene father of them all
Bows down his summer head below the west.
Now am I of breath, speech, and speed possest,940
But at the setting I must bid adieu
To her for the last time. Night will strew
On the damp grass myriads of lingering leaves,
And with them shall I die; nor much it grieves
To die, when summer dies on the cold sward.
Why, I have been a butterfly, a lord
Of flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies,
Groves, meadows, melodies, and arbour roses;
My kingdom's at its death, and just it is
That I should die with it: so in all this950
We miscal grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe,
What is there to plain of? By Titan's foe
I am but rightly serv'd." So saying, he
Tripp'd lightly on, in sort of deathful glee;
Laughing at the clear stream and setting sun,
As though they jests had been: nor had he done
His laugh at nature's holy countenance,
Until that grove appear'd, as if perchance,
And then his tongue with sober seemlihed
Gave utterance as he entered: "Ha!" I said,960
"King of the butterflies; but by this gloom,
And by old Rhadamanthus' tongue of doom,
This dusk religion, pomp of solitude,
And the Promethean clay by thief endued,
By old Saturnus' forelock, by his head
Shook with eternal palsy, I did wed
Myself to things of light from infancy;
And thus to be cast out, thus lorn to die,
Is sure enough to make a mortal man
Grow impious." So he inwardly began970
On things for which no wording can be found;
Deeper and deeper sinking, until drown'd
Beyond the reach of music: for the choir
Of Cynthia he heard not, though rough briar
Nor muffling thicket interpos'd to dull
The vesper hymn, far swollen, soft and full,
Through the dark pillars of those sylvan aisles.
He saw not the two maidens, nor their smiles,
Wan as primroses gather'd at midnight
By chilly finger'd spring. "Unhappy wight!980
Endymion!" said Peona, "we are here!
What wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier?"
Then he embrac'd her, and his lady's hand
Press'd, saying: "Sister, I would have command,
If it were heaven's will, on our sad fate."
At which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate
And said, in a new voice, but sweet as love,
To Endymion's amaze: "By Cupid's dove,
And so thou shalt! and by the lily truth
Of my own breast thou shalt, beloved youth!"990
And as she spake, into her face there came
Light, as reflected from a silver flame:
Her long black hair swell'd ampler, in display
Full golden; in her eyes a brighter day
Dawn'd blue and full of love. Aye, he beheld
Phœbe, his passion! joyous she upheld
Her lucid bow, continuing thus: "Drear, drear
Has our delaying been; but foolish fear
Withheld me first; and then decrees of fate;
And then 'twas fit that from this mortal state1000
Thou shouldst, my love, by some unlook'd for change
Be spiritualiz'd. Peona, we shall range
These forests, and to thee they safe shall be
As was thy cradle; hither shalt thou flee
To meet us many a time." Next Cynthia bright
Peona kiss'd, and bless'd with fair good night:
Her brother kiss'd her too, and knelt adown
Before his goddess, in a blissful swoon.
She gave her fair hands to him, and behold,
Before three swiftest kisses he had told,1010
They vanish'd far away!–Peona went
Home through the gloomy wood in wonderment.
THE END.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

TABLE DES MATIÈRES

[Pg 4]

[Pg 5] Ceci n'est pas une Préface, ni même une Introduction, mais plutôt l'ouverture d'un vaste Poème symphonique, composé de nombreux morceaux distincts les uns des autres, présentant toutefois un ensemble très cohérent. Celui qui l'écrit n'a d'autres prétentions que de grouper les principales mélodies de ce Poème, et de les coordonner de façon à en démontrer l'idée générale, à en prouver l'unité. Il a cherché à disparaître le plus possible, à rendre aussi ténus et aussi inapercevables que possible, les liens qui rattachent entre eux ces leitmotiv, mais il n'a pas osé, et il s'en excuse, les supprimer complètement, craignant que, sans ces modulations transitoires les changements de tons ne parussent trop brusques[1]. Le thème principal, celui vers lequel convergent tous les autres, c'est la personnalité du Poète, ou plutôt sa sensibilité: car leur union était tellement intime qu'elles ne faisaient qu'un tout harmonieux.

Or, cette sensibilité a peu varié: Keats a produit [Pg 6]sa première œuvre connue en 1813, l'Imitation de Spenser[2] et son dernier Sonnet[3] en 1820. Le proverbe latin est parfois véridique: les dieux païens qu'il avait tant aimés, le lui rendirent et le rappelèrent auprès d'eux avec une hâte qui semble plutôt la caractéristique du xixe siècle, dans lequel vécut leur chantre que l'apanage des époques reculées où ils régissaient l'univers. Entre 18 et 25 ans, la qualité des sensations ne se modifie guère, à moins d'une maladie; et celle qui étreignit l'infortuné l'emporta si rapidement qu'elle lui laissa à peine le temps d'écrire quelques pièces, parmi lesquelles trois ou quatre Sonnets, au plus, sont remarquables.

John Keats, né le 29 ou le 31 octobre 1795 à Moorfields, Finsbury Pavement, au cœur de Londres, est mort le 23 février 1821 à Rome, Piazza di Spagna. Aucun fait mémorable entre ces deux dates! Aucun du moins qui aurait pu exercer une influence quelconque sur son esprit ou changer le cours de ses idées!

On chercherait vainement à retrouver, chez ses parents, l'origine d'une disposition artistique: il connut à peine son père qui tenait une remise de voitures en location et mourut jeune; sa mère intelligente et très ardente pour le plaisir, se remaria [Pg 7]presque aussitôt et mourut six ans après (1810). Jusque là il avait étudié à l'école d'Enfield; une fois orphelin, ses tuteurs le placèrent immédiatement en apprentissage chez un médecin. Quand on aura appris, en outre, qu'il eut deux frères[4] et une sœur, que ses amis furent le peintre Haydon[5], Leigh Hunt[6] directeur de l'Examiner, Mathew[7], Cowden Clarke[8], Hamilton Reynolds[9], tous les trois littérateurs, on saura ce que sa vie offre de saillant avant sa crise amoureuse.

Toujours et sans relâche le tantalisa la même passion pour la Poésie et pour la Beauté, son unique passion, pourrait-on affirmer, si tout à la fin de son existence il n'avait subi la dite crise, et ne s'était épris d'une jeune fille, d'ailleurs absolument incapable de le comprendre. Il faut même se hâter d'ajouter qu'aucune œuvre importante ne lui a été suggérée par cette Fanny, qui écrivait à un ami, M. Dilke, dix ans après la mort de son fiancé: «L'acte le plus charitable serait de le laisser reposer à jamais dans l'obscurité à laquelle l'avaient condamné les circonstances.»

[Pg 8]Telle est, à peu près, la seule expérience personnelle qu'il ait pu faire de l'humanité; car si les articles injurieux, que lui décochèrent les critiques patentés, l'émurent un instant, il avait heureusement, quoi qu'ait dit Byron[10], trop de lucidité et de clairvoyance, malgré sa jeunesse, pour ne pas se rendre compte des défectuosités que pouvaient contenir les œuvres incriminées, défectuosités qu'il a confessées lui-même, à plusieurs reprises avec la plus entière bonne foi.

Il vécut donc exclusivement une vie d'artiste écartant résolument de sa pensée tout ce qui pouvait en amoindrir la souplesse, contaminer l'innocence des organes récepteurs et disséminer son énergie cérébrale. Ainsi il s'exaspérait contre les savants, les philosophes et les historiens:

... Tous les charmes ne sont-ils pas rompus
Au simple contact de la froide philosophie?
Il y avait un arc-en-ciel que nous vénérions autrefois;
Nous connaissons sa trame, sa contexture; elle est donnée
Platement dans le catalogue des choses communes.
Le philosophe rognera les ailes de l'ange,
Conquerra les mystères à l'aide de règles et de lignes.
Videra l'atmosphère hanté, la mine qu'habitent les gnomes[11]...

Hors d'ici! histoire pompeuse! hors! fourberie dorée!
Sombre planète dans l'univers des faits!
[Pg 9]Vaste mer qui élève un murmure sans fin
Sur les rivages caillouteux de la mémoire[12]...
De même, alors que la plupart des écrivains de son temps, en réaction contre les opinions sceptiques du xviiie siècle et de la Révolution française vitupéraient les Républicains et prenaient la défense du Christianisme, alors que Byron procurait à la religion une vigueur nouvelle par l'excès même de ses insultes, et que Shelley la discutait de toute la force de son génie et de sa dialectique, ce qui était encore une manière d'en reconnaître la vitalité, Keats, plus radical et plus orgueilleux, la négligeait. Quand, par exception, il y faisait allusion, c'était avec un dédain marqué:

Toujours, toujours les cloches sonnent, et j'en sentirais un froid humide,
Un frisson comme celui qui émane de la tombe, si je ne savais
Qu'elles vont mourir, comme une lampe dont l'huile est consumée,
Que c'est leur dernier soupir, leur lamentation, avant de rentrer
Dans l'oubli[13].................
Sa profonde admiration pour la splendeur des images, pour le diapason sourd et puissant qui le ravissaient en Milton, ne l'empêchait pas de se révolter contre son austérité de sectaire. Il s'intéressait encore moins à la lutte gigantesque que [Pg 10]soutenait sa patrie contre Napoléon. Que lui importent les dissensions des hommes et des nations! Que lui importe l'action brutale! C'est devant les conflits des éléments[14] que vibrent ses sens, que s'échauffe sa verve, que s'exalte son inspiration. La pression des événements ne pèse pas sur lui. De là, du reste, un défaut assez frappant que ses ennemis n'ont pas manqué de faire ressortir: ses personnages sont comme lui, ils éprouvent des accès de joies, de colères, de jouissances et de douleurs de toutes sortes, ils se taisent, ils vocifèrent: ils n'agissent que rarement.

Dans la Veille de sainte Agnès, Porphyro entasse les sucreries et les fruits:

....... De sa cachette il rapporta un monceau
De pommes candies, de coings, de prunes, de courges
Puis des gelées plus savoureuses que le lait caillé.
Et des sirops rutilants, colorés avec de la canelle;
De la manne et des dattes, transportées par mer,
Cueillies à Fez; et des friandises aromatisées...[15]
Mais ni le héros ni son amante n'y goûteront; le poète s'est simplement laissé emporter par le chatoiement et la musique des mots.

Peut-être des éplucheurs hargneux et moroses seraient-ils en droit de lui reprocher une certaine exubérance irraisonnée en même temps qu'une [Pg 11]étroitesse voulue, conséquences inévitables de pareils partis pris? Peut-être des défenseurs, trop favorables, auraient-ils, à leur tour, le droit d'invoquer la brièveté de sa vie qui ne lui permit pas de faire saillir tout ce qui était en germe dans son cerveau?

Quoiqu'il en soit, ce regret une fois discrètement exprimé, il faut, sans plus, constater que, dans un si court laps de temps, il n'a pu avoir qu'une manière. Evidemment—et il n'est pas téméraire de le supposer—s'il eût atteint sa pleine maturité, il eût élargi son champ d'activité intellectuelle, eût concentré davantage les sujets de ses poèmes et les eût mieux composés; mais, qui osera soutenir qu'il aurait rendu plus parfaits ses chefs-d'œuvre: la classique Ode sur l'Urne grecque[16] par exemple, ou l'admirable fragment de l'Ode à Maïa[17] ou même une œuvre de jeunesse écrite lorsqu'il n'avait que vingt ans, le Sonnet: «En ouvrant pour la première fois l'Homère de Chapman[18]», etc...

Cet amour de la forme et de sa perfection était tellement inné en lui que dès ses débuts, on ne sent presque aucune hésitation, aucun tâtonnement. Son éducation première n'ayant pas été très poussée, son seul instinct l'avait incité à lire [Pg 12]Virgile et à s'enivrer d'Homère, lorsqu'un ami lui avait prêté la traduction du vieux Chapman. A cette époque (1816) Lord Elgin rapportait à Londres les métopes du Parthénon; immédiatement les plus grands sculpteurs anglais, Flaxman, Nollekens et Chantrey s'imprégnaient de la tradition grecque. Très impressionné lui-même, il écrit aussitôt:

Ainsi causent une vertigineuse souffrance ces merveilles
Dans lesquelles on trouve mélangée la grandeur grecque avec la rude
Destruction du vieux temps[19]......
Ce fut donc tout d'abord la grâce idéale de la Beauté hellénique qui s'empara de sa jeune âme bien disposée à subir une pareille invasion. Presque simultanément, certains savoureux poètes de l'Italie, de la France et de l'Angleterre, l'Arioste et le Dante[20], Ronsard[21], Chaucer, Drayton et Fletcher[22], Spenser[23], Shakspeare[24], Milton[25], Coleridge[26] [Pg 13]l'enthousiasmèrent par leur harmonieuse richesse et lui inculquèrent un goût parfois excessif pour le luxe et l'abondance des descriptions.

... Pâles étaient les douces lèvres que je vis,
Pâles les lèvres que je baisai, et enchanteresse la forme
Que j'étreignis en flottant au milieu de cette lugubre tempête[27]

Les voyelles Spensériennes qui prennent leur essor en toute aisance
Et flottent comme les oiseaux sur la mer estivale;
Les tempêtes Miltoniennes et plus encore la tendresse Miltonienne...

Adieu! une fois encore la lutte farouche
Entre le Tourment de l'Enfer et l'argile impassible
M'enflammera; une fois encore j'expérimenterai
L'amère suavité de ce fruit Shakspearien.
L'influence de Chatterton[28] très perceptible chez lui, surtout à la fin de sa vie, doit être classée à part: était-elle le prodrome d'une nouvelle orientation de son génie, d'une évolution vers des sujets moins sensuels et plus empreints de sentimentalité? La venue de sa maladie le rendit-elle plus accessible à l'incurable mélancolie du poète qu'il admirait? La mort prématurée de Keats nous [Pg 14]met dans l'impossibilité d'élucider ce problème.

Pendant ses années de pleine activité productrice, son art avait été éminemment impersonnel; il jugeait mélodramatique de crier, comme Byron, ses propres douleurs à la foule. Pour lui, la Muse ne devait, à aucun prix, se faire la confidente des joies ou des affres du poète, et s'il fût resté, dans son intégralité absolue, lui-même, incontestablement certaines de ses poésies des dernières années n'eûssent pas vu le jour.

Il est en effet, de tous les écrivains de sa génération, le plus purement poète: la conception de la Beauté constitue l'axe intime de son Etre, et son imagination tressaille au moindre appel de cette Beauté. Plus qu'aucun autre, il éprouve les tortures de la lutte avec le style, avec l'épithète utile, avec le mot qui fait éviter une périphrase, avec la période bien équilibrée. Pour aucun de ses émules ce n'était l'unique préoccupation.

Crabbe, observateur consciencieux et pitoyable des classes pauvres, émeut bien davantage par la peinture énergique de leurs misères que par le rythme de ses vers.

Landor, réputé comme le fondateur de «l'Art pour l'Art», s'est tellement enflammé pour les théories libérales qu'après avoir soutenu de ses deniers la Révolution française, il avait, plus tard, pour lutter contre l'asservissement de l'Europe par Napoléon, entretenu à ses frais et commandé [Pg 15]comme colonel un régiment en Espagne sous les ordres de Wellington.

Campbell l'Ecossais et Moore l'Irlandais, peu érudits, et documentés sur l'Art Grec par de simples traductions, revêtent leurs chant nationaux d'uniformes classiques.

Walter Scott s'attarde dans la narration pittoresque, imite de vieilles ballades, décrit de vieux châteaux, de vieilles amours et de vieux combats.

Southey dans sa jeunesse, un des plus chauds partisans des idées nouvelles, s'incorpore ensuite dans le parti conservateur.

Coleridge laisse évaporer son inspiration dans les nuages de la métaphysique allemande.

Le délicieux humoriste Lamb veille avec une adorable sollicitude sur sa sœur, pauvre folle qui avait tué sa mère dans un accès de délire.

L'opulent Lord Byron, si merveilleusement doué pour chanter toutes les véhémences, mésuse de son talent en diatribes contre la société et en injures contre la vie qui l'avait comblé. Il a tout épuisé, tout ce qui eût contenté l'ambition d'un autre homme: passion du jeu, des femmes, de la gloire. Son dévouement pour une noble cause et sa vaillance pendant les derniers mois de son existence ont plus servi sa renommée que ses meilleurs poèmes.

Wordsworth compose des vers exquis sur des thèmes souvent par trop insignifiants, fastidieusement et invariablement édifiants.

[Pg 16]Le généreux Shelley, le plus génial de tous, plus génial que Keats lui-même, considère la poésie comme l'expression la plus haute de la philosophie, «comme une sorte d'ascension indéfinie vers le bien de l'humanité», rêve des réformes sociales, et parfois se perd dans l'infini, ainsi qu'il était arrivé, dans le second Faust, à son seul rival, le grand Gœthe.

«C'est une sensation désagréable, a écrit Novalis, le plus proche de l'auteur d'Endymion parmi les écrivains allemands, d'entendre des mots superflus lorsqu'il y a un but déterminé à atteindre, et comme la poésie n'est autre chose qu'un superflu cultivé, une chose qui se développe elle-même, elle devient absolument répugnante lorsqu'elle n'est pas à sa place, lorsqu'elle veut raisonner et argumenter, et, en général, lorsqu'elle assume un air sérieux: elle n'est plus poésie.»

Pour Keats, l'Art est une entéléchie, une fin en soi. Et comme il n'a jamais admis qu'une sensation fût une chose moins relevée qu'une idée ou un sentiment, il lui suffit que la poésie concrétise avec intensité l'extase que font naître les impressions innombrables qu'il reçoit du dehors.

Des phénomènes insignifiants, qui passeraient inaperçus pour tout être moins perméable, développent en lui une activité sensorielle qui met en jeu les uns ou les autres de ses sens, ou tous à la fois. Une fermentation, un travail exclusivement [Pg 17]interne, se produisent alors, lents, inconscients, qui surexcitent certaines de ses facultés et paralysent les autres. Nulle inquiétude, nulle curiosité ne le poussent plus vers un non-moi quelconque. Ce qu'il a emmagasiné dans la fièvre l'absorbe uniquement, et, pendant cette incubation, le merveilleux spectacle de l'univers ne l'émeut plus assez pour qu'il daigne en prendre sa part. Un seul désir le hante désormais, égoïste, farouche: décomposer et analyser les principes premiers de la sensation répercutée en son tréfonds, ressusciter la naïveté et la simplicité primordiale de toutes choses, découvrir leur entité pour s'expliquer à soi-même leur profonde, leur véritable signification, pour, en son propre moi, comme en un creuset, reconstituer et recombiner ces éléments épars, les fondre, les modeler de façon à leur donner, sous une forme nouvelle, l'expression la plus définitive.

«Les hommes de génie, a-t-il dit en manière de boutade, n'ont pas d'individualité propre... Le poète n'est pas lui-même, il n'a point de moi, il est tout et il n'est rien... Quand je suis dans une chambre avec d'autres personnes, l'identité de chacune d'elles exerce immédiatement une pression sur moi, si bien que je suis, en très peu de temps, annihilé.» Comme conséquence de cette extériorisation, constante sauf pendant les heures d'élaboration, si, par suite de son obstination à négliger et à mépriser la science et l'histoire, son érudition [Pg 18]est par instants en défaut, son observation directe est toujours scrupuleusement exacte; les mœurs et les instincts de tous les êtres vivants de la création ne méritent-ils pas son attention au même titre? Tous ne sont-ils pas, à son égal, Citoyens de la Nature?

Le poète .......... a entendu
Le rugissement du lion et peut dire
Ce qu'exprime sa gorge rugueuse;
Et, pour lui, le hurlement du tigre
A une signification, et frappe
Son oreille comme une langue maternelle[29].
De même, il avait atteint un degré de porosité tel qu'il faisait pour ainsi dire, partie des éléments. Devant un rayon de soleil il ne se possédait plus, il s'enivrait des transparences de l'atmosphère, de la course incessante des nuages pourpres, gris d'or ou argentés, des miroitements du flot irisé, de la fluidité et de la diaphanéité apparente des objets sous les reflets du ciel bleu. Le cri du grillon[30], le bourdonnement d'une abeille, la senteur d'une fleur, la vue de la mer faisaient frémir tout son être: ses yeux étincelaient et ses lèvres tremblaient.

Oh! combien j'aime, par un beau soir d'été,
Lorsque des torrents de lumière déversent l'or à l'Occident
[Pg 19]Et que, sur les zéphyrs embaumés, reposent immobiles
Les nuages argentés[31].........

Les zéphyrs étaient éthérés et purs
Et s'insinuaient à travers les croisées mi-closes pour guérir
Les malades languissants, rafraîchissant leur fiévreux assoupissement[32].

Les nuages étaient purs et blancs, comme des troupeaux fraîchement tondus.
Et sortant d'un clair ruisseau; paisiblement ils reposaient
Sur les champs azurés du ciel[33].......

O vous! qui avez les prunelles meurtries et lassées,
Régalez les devant l'immensité de la mer!
O vous! dont les oreilles sont assourdies de rudes vacarmes
Ou sursaturées de fades mélodies,
Asseyez-vous à l'entrée de quelque vieille caverne, et méditez[34].
Chacun de ses sens est en un éveil perpétuel! Avant Huysmans, il sait dissocier les différentes odeurs; il sait aussi de leur association composer une sorte de symphonie:

Dans la nuit embaumée je devine la senteur spéciale
Dont chaque mois parfume
Le gazon, le hallier, le fruit de l'arbre sauvage,
La blanche aubépine, et l'églantine des champs[35]...
[Pg 20]Voici une remarque précieuse qui atteste la sincérité de son art; un idéaliste aurait glissé sur ce détail. Seul un précurseur du naturalisme[36] pouvait le noter:

Au lieu de saveurs agréables son énorme palais ne percevait
Que le goût empoisonné du cuivre ou d'un métal corrompu[37].
Personne n'a défini mieux que lui, avec une prédilection plus marquée, les sensations du goût:

Oh! qui me donnera une gorgée d'un vin
Longtemps refroidi dans la terre profonde,
D'un vin qui sente Flora et la campagne verte[38].
Il est tellement peintre que pas une finesse du ton qu'il décrit ne lui échappe:

Le bleu! c'est la vie du firmament, le domaine
De Cynthia—le vaste palais du Soleil!
C'est la tente d'Hespérus et de toute sa suite,
Le cœur même des nuages, or, gris et brun;
Le bleu! c'est la vie des eaux[39]...

Nuance tout ce qui a une teinte vermillon.
Que la rose s'épanouisse et réchauffe l'atmosphère,
[Pg 21]Que le vin écarlate écume dans le gobelet
Frais comme une source bouillonnante, que les coquilles aux bords décolorés,
Sur le sable, ou sous les insondables profondeurs, deviennent pourpres
Dans tous leurs circuits, que la jeune fille
Rougisse vivement, comme surprise par quelqu'ardent baiser[40]!
Quelle richesse de palette! Est-il possible d'exprimer plus picturalement avec des mots les somptuosités et les variétés d'une même tonalité? Chaque mot est lui-même une teinte dont Keats par une juxtaposition calculée atténue ou vivifie les différentes nuances avec un raffinement inouï. Si ce n'était paraître jouer trop facilement sur les vocables, les termes concernant la peinture et la musique ayant une excessive identité, on pourrait se croire autorisé, après avoir lu ce morceau à haute voix dans l'original, à soutenir qu'on a entendu une gamme, à spécifier où se trouvent les tons et les demi-tons, à vérifier et à justifier cette assertion, un peu audacieuse, en constatant, qu'images, harmonie, et pensées sont ici concomitantes.

Nulle confusion suspecte, cependant, nulle interversion n'est perceptible entre les différents arts. Constellations d'un même orbe, ils cheminent sans se choquer ni s'entraver, bien que leurs routes ne [Pg 22]soient qu'entrelacements continuels. Chacun use de ses moyens propres: il y a simplement émulation, superposition. Quel que soit celui auquel il défère momentanément la prédominance, le poète, quand il conçoit et élabore une œuvre, les subordonne invariablement tous à la poésie. Il n'hésite d'ailleurs pas à emprunter leurs procédés au peintre, au sculpteur, au musicien, soit pendant la préparation, soit pendant l'exécution, selon qu'ils lui semblent mieux convenir au sujet qu'il aura à traiter.

Après avoir, en une esquisse très largement brossée, établi d'abord ses grandes lignes, le peintre[41] choisit une couleur, une clé, devant servir d'assiette normale à son tableau et constituer la base solide sur laquelle s'appuiera l'infinité des plans formés par les dégradations successives de cette unique couleur; ensuite, ses effets de lumière et d'ombre, toujours en camaïeu, judicieusement distribués, il fait chanter çà et là, non la note banale des tons complémentaires, mais la fanfare plus tapageuse de tons très distants s'harmonisant sans heurts. Keats, lui aussi, avant d'accorder entre elles ses colorations ou ses sonorités et de faire retentir leur puissante polyphonie, prend minutieusement [Pg 23]soin de trouver, en premier lieu, le point de départ, la clé.

Il excelle à créer cette ambiance: parfois le vague et l'incertain planent autour de ses personnages, entretenus par des imprécisions voulues de termes[42] et d'images[43]:

.. Des vitres en losange d'une bizarre invention,
Riche en couleurs et en teintes splendides,
Comme sont les ailes sombres et damasquinées du papillon de nuit
Et au milieu entre mille figures héraldiques...

Une idée lui vint comme une rose épanouie..
Parfois l'immobilité et le silence figent toute sa description:

Bel éphèbe, sous ces arbres, tu ne peux quitter
Ta chanson, pas plus que les arbres ne quittent leurs feuilles,
Audacieux amoureux, jamais, jamais tu n'obtiens les baisers
Quoique tu sois proche du but[44]......
Ici, c'est l'art du statuaire qui lui inspire cet effet de plastique insurpassable. Il semble impossible de rassembler avec plus d'à propos les mots et les tours de phrase qui suggéreront la vision de gestes [Pg 24]subitement arrêtés en leur élan, comme dans une photographie instantanée.

Si, au contraire, il veut rendre la succession et la plus ou moins grande rapidité des mouvements, il va de soi qu'il s'adressera au compositeur. C'est à l'école de celui-ci qu'il apprendra en quelque sorte, l'usage du métronome, c'est-à-dire qu'il prescrira, dès le début de chacune de ses pièces par le choix de sa stance et de la mesure de son vers, quel rythme devra adopter celui qui récitera son œuvre, de même que par la position de la pause (ou césure) il le contraindra de reprendre haleine à tel endroit, de façon à précipiter ensuite ou à ralentir son débit, suivant qu'après cet arrêt de respiration il y aura plus ou moins de syllabes à prononcer.

Il fera preuve, pour diversifier rythmes et pauses, d'une imperturbable sagacité et d'une science impeccable puisée chez chacun des poètes qui avaient été «la nourriture de son imagination[45]»; il en approfondit la maîtrise et se l'approprie avec un bonheur inouï.

Pour Isabelle[46], ou le Pot de Basilic, dont le canevas est emprunté à Boccace, il se sert, après Chaucer[47], de la désinvolte Ottava Rima si chère aux poètes italiens.

[Pg 25]Pour la Veille de Sainte Agnès[48], la Stance Spensérienne avec ses neuf vers, dont le dernier est un alexandrin, lui a semblé par cet allongement fournir une chute plus majestueuse à sa strophe.

Avant de commencer Lamia[49], il étudie Dryden, dont il s'assimile l'aisance dans la facture du même alexandrin, assoupli et libéré cette fois: alternativement alerte et pompeux, ce mètre avait toute la variété qui convenait pour dépeindre, soit la démarche sinueuse de la femme-serpent, soit la grandiose fantasmagorie de l'orgie qu'elle préside en son palais.

S'il veut représenter, dans Hypérion[50] la lutte des forces cosmiques, il prendra pour modèle l'ampleur et l'envergure de la période Miltonienne: qu'on lise dans le texte anglais ce passage d'une quiétude déjà Olympienne—bien avant que l'Olympe fût consacré;—est-il possible de concevoir un adagio plus solennel et d'une sérénité plus imposante:

... Dans l'extase d'une nuit d'été
Ces sénateurs des bois puissants, en leur verte parure,
[Pg 26]Les chênes élevés, aux branches enchantées par l'ardeur des étoiles.
Rêvent, et rêvent ainsi, toute la nuit, sans autre frémissement
Que celui de la brise qui s'enfle graduellement dans la solitude,
Domine le silence, puis s'évanouit,
Comme une marée montante qui n'aurait qu'une vague[51]...
D'autrefois la diction sera haletante et fébrile, en allure de scherzo:

Que toujours la Fantaisie puisse vagabonder,
Le plaisir n'est jamais au logis:
Au plus doux contact le plaisir s'évapore,
Telles les bulles d'air assaillies par la pluie;
Que la Fantaisie erre donc[52].......
Certains de ces morceaux, par contre, sont célèbres pour la multiplicité de leurs mouvements et l'ingéniosité de leurs innombrables modulations que pacifient par échappées de furtifs retours au ton initial; celui qui commence ainsi, entre autres, dont la traduction ne donne, hélas! aucune idée sous ce rapport:

Sur les flancs du Latmos s'étendait
Une puissante forêt[53].....
Le musicien lui expliquera encore quelle est [Pg 27]l'importance d'un ton plus haut ou plus bas, quelles lettres enflent ou assourdissent la voix, la rendent plus grave ou plus aiguë, lui dira qu'il faut être ménager de ses timbres, ne pas, à moins de chercher un effet, fatiguer son auditeur en faisant sonner indéfiniment les mêmes, préparer au contraire leur rentrée de manière à lui procurer une surprise, une sensation d'inattendu:

Inspectons la lyre, calculons la résonnance
De chaque corde, et voyons ce qui peut être gagné
Par une oreille industrieuse et une patiente attention,
Avare du son et de la syllabe[54]......
Aucun poète a-t-il possédé à un degré supérieur l'instinct du vers plein et vibrant? Aucun s'est-il enivré davantage du charme du son et des rimes, du rappel des assonnances amené par un luxe incroyable de répétitions savamment disposées[55]. Tantôt les unissons lui semblent préférables, et tantôt il joue sur les différentes prononciations d'une même voyelle, cas assez fréquent dans la langue anglaise.

Tour à tour il sait reposer l'oreille par des cadences alanguies, puis la réveiller soudain avec le fier cliquetis des consonnes métalliques. S'il a besoin de nouvelles cordes à sa lyre, comme Berlioz [Pg 28]faisant plus tard le désespoir de ses artistes et les forçant d'attaquer sur leurs cors des notes inemployées auparavant, il invente des accords qui indignent les pusillanimes et les officiels. Quels étranges adjectifs attirent tout à coup notre attention? Effarés de les entendre, les puristes d'Outre-Manche crient au scandale en invoquant grammaire et dictionnaires. Keats s'inquiète peu de leur colère: pour rendre son orchestration plus aérienne, sa fantaisie a forgé des mots «psalterian»[56] et «piazzian» dont la première syllabe ressemble au pincement de la harpe et dont la terminaison rappelle sa résonnance nasillarde.

Maintes fois cependant, grisé par le susurrement des s et des z, par l'élancement des h et le balancement des allitérations, il se laisse aller à ne plus donner de sens à la musique de ses paroles; il lui arrive encore d'atténuer outre mesure les contours sous l'amoncellement des empâtements, de diluer les couleurs, tant il en force l'éclat. Alors, comme chez son compatriote Turner, idée et image, tout disparaît dans un poudroiement d'or au milieu d'un prestigieux flamboiement: il ne peint plus que la lumière! La poésie est une pluie sans fin de lumière[57].

C'est un vertige presque irrésistible qui l'entraîne! [Pg 29]Combien il lui est, la plupart du temps difficile de réfréner cette fougueuse, cette impérieuse imagination! Il faut reconnaître, pour être équitable, que dans ses chefs-d'œuvre—et ils sont nombreux,—il est resté maître de lui-même: aussitôt, les nuances et les harmonies et ses phrases en doublent la signification, et il lui a suffi de s'en tenir au diapason et au rythme qu'il avait adoptés avec tant de discernement.

La belle Dame sans Mercy est peut-être, de toute l'œuvre du maître écrivain, la pièce capitale en laquelle idée, image et musique s'équilibrent dans les proportions les plus justes avec la perfection la plus inattaquable[58].

Un poète aussi exclusivement sensuel, qui n'écrivait que sous la fascination et la domination de ses sens, qui s'écriait: «O vivre d'une vie de sensations plutôt que de pensées!» devait surtout choisir comme types d'humanité des personnages animés de passions violentes, de la passion surtout la plus insurmontable de toutes, de l'amour. C'est avec l'amitié le sentiment qu'il a le mieux interprété:

............... leur couronne
Est tressée d'amour et d'amitié, et siège haut
[Pg 30]Sur le front de l'humanité;
Sa valeur la plus pesante et la plus volumineuse
Est l'amitié d'où émane sans cesse
Une splendeur persistante; mais au sommet
Est suspendue, par d'invisibles fils, une sphère
De lumière, c'est l'amour: son influence
Frappant nos yeux, engendre un sens nouveau[59]..
Encore doit-on constater qu'il a plutôt chanté la Volupté que l'Amour pur:

Elle pleure solitaire ses plaisirs perdus,
Douloureusement elle pleure jusqu'à la venue de la nuit,
Puis alors, au lieu d'amour, o Misère!
Elle médita solitaire sur la Volupté.....
Mais l'égoïsme, cousin de l'amour n'imposa pas longtemps
La brûlante insomnie en son sein seulement:
Elle se consuma dans l'attente de l'heure fortunée et compta
Les instants fiévreusement, haletante, sans relâche[60].
De même, dans la pièce adressée à Fanny, la fiancée dont il a été parlé plus haut, qui partait pour un bal auquel le poète jaloux ne pouvait pas assister, ce sont surtout des émotions physiques qu'il traduit:

Ah! que du moins ta main ne soit saisie par personne!
Laisse, laisse les amoureux se consumer—
[Pg 31]Mais, je t'en supplie, ne détourne pas
Sitôt de moi, l'élan de ton cœur;
Oh! conserve, par charité.
Les pulsations les plus vives pour moi[61]!
En réalité, il ne se trouve pas à l'aise avec les femmes, les jugeant trop peu homogènes. Il reproche à ses contemporaines de ne pas assez ressembler aux Nymphes de l'Ilyssus. Aucune, d'ailleurs ne fit faire de folies à ce sensuel qui ne l'était que par la pensée. C'est encore la Beauté qu'il poursuit en elles; et rapidement désillusionné, il leur témoigne un mépris formel:

Femme, lorsque je te vois bavarde, vaine
Inconstante, puérile, orgueilleuse et pleine de caprices..
Aussitôt mon âme tressaute et se réjouit
De ce que, si longtemps, je sois resté fermé à l'amour[62].
«Je sens, écrit-il à Bayley, que je ne suis pas juste envers les femmes. J'essaie, en ce moment, de leur rendre justice; je ne puis. Est-ce parce qu'elles sont tellement au-dessous de mes imaginations d'adolescent? Quand j'étais écolier, je considérais une belle femme comme une déesse.»

Et, comme sa fiancée semble se plaindre qu'il s'adresse plutôt à sa beauté qu'à elle-même, par divination sans doute, et pressentant intuitivement [Pg 32]une rivalité qu'elle se définissait mal à elle-même, il lui répond:

«Pourquoi ne puis-je parler de votre beauté? Aurais-je pu vous aimer sans cela? Je ne puis concevoir d'autre origine à mon amour pour vous que votre beauté.»

Dans l'amitié même, il ne sépare pas ses amis de son art:

Douces sont les joies que procure la poésie,
Et doublement douces quand elle chante une fraternité!
Et aucun souvenir, Matthew, ne peut évoquer à nos yeux
Un destin plus plaisant, une jouissance plus vraie
Que celui dans lesquels s'ébattent deux poètes[63]..
Poésie! Beauté! voilà donc les deux mots qui se trouvent à tout propos sous sa plume, quel que soit le thème qui l'inspire: émotion des sens, amour, amitié, etc... C'est son Credo, c'est l'unité profonde de sa pensée:

Une chose de Beauté est une joie éternelle[64]...

L'art suffit à tout, l'art purifie tout, ennoblit tout:
........... Le véritable but
De la poésie, c'est qu'elle doit être une amie
Qui allège les soucis et élève les pensées des hommes[65].
C'est-à-dire que, s'il n'est ni chauvin, ni religieux, [Pg 33]s'il juge sévèrement la science et l'histoire qui dépoétisent son domaine, il n'est pas indifférent, ni égoïste. Car la poésie lui fait aimer la nature et chacun des phénomènes qui embrasent son imagination, elle lui fait chérir tout ce qui palpite sous le soleil,

ses frères:

Bien des veillées semblables de doux chuchotement
Puissions-nous passer ensemble, et ressentir dans le calme
Ce que sont les vraies joies d'ici bas—avant que la grande voix.
De la céleste bouche ordonne à nos esprits de prendre notre vol[66].
ses amis:

......... et sûrement ce doit être
A peu près la plus haute félicité humaine
Lorsque, dans tes retraites, se réfugient deux âmes sœurs[67]!
l'humanité entière sans distinction de castes ni de nations, tous les êtres qui bondissent, rampent, volent, nagent, sur terre, dans les airs ou sous les eaux; mais la poésie lui fait aussi haïr sa férocité; et plus d'une fois, cette férocité mêle d'amertume l'ivresse qui l'envahit en face des spectacles les plus enchanteurs de cette marâtre:

......... La vaste mer roulait
Sans fracas une frange d'écume argentée...
[Pg 34]Et mon bonheur eût été complet!—mais je voyais
Trop profondément dans les espaces sous-marins, où chaque estomac,
S'il est le plus fort, se nourrit du plus faible, éternellement[68]!
C'est dans un pareil état d'âme qu'on discerne l'influence de Chatterton auquel il dédiait ces vers:

........ Aux sphères qui tourbillonnent
Tu chantes harmonieusement; rien ne gâte tes hymnes
Au-dessus du monde ingrat et des humaines épouvantes[69].
Ces crises de découragement prouvent que, s'il avait vécu plus longtemps, ce païen endurci aurait probablement fini par partager l'angoisse moderne. Depuis son plus jeune âge, une surexcitation nerveuse d'une prodigieuse intensité enfiévrait, sans lui laisser de repos, toutes les fibres de son être: il était miné. Aussi, qu'un accident survienne et l'influence du suicidé de 17 ans prédominera de plus en plus! Une maladie l'atteint dont les germes avaient été contractés pendant une tournée en Ecosse; c'en est fait, l'infortuné sera vite abattu. Déjà s'étaient trahis quelques symptômes de dépression, qui désormais iront s'aggravant sans relâche; en visitant la tombe de Burns, notamment:

[Pg 35]
Tout est froide Beauté; le chagrin ne passe jamais[70].....
Qu'elle est loin la hautaine ironie du sonnet dans le dernier vers duquel il avait précédemment fait allusion à la mort du poète qu'il préférait maintenant:

Les pensées les plus calmes flottent autour de nous, celles des feuilles.
Qui bourgeonnent.—le fruit mûrissant en silence.....
Un ruisselet sous bois—une mort de Poète[71].
Oui, c'en est fait! Keats n'est plus Keats! et l'inexorable destin lui refuse les années qu'il avait réclamées autrefois pour se manifester dans son entière éclosion:

Oh! pour dix ans que je puisse m'abîmer
Dans la poésie, que je puisse accomplir la tâche
Que mon âme s'est imposée[72].....
Ce vœu, formulé en 1817, ne sera pas réalisé. Les médecins lui conseillant de chercher en Italie une température plus clémente, il se décide à quitter l'Angleterre avec son ami, le peintre Severn, qui sera dorénavant son unique confident et le soutiendra fidèlement pendant ses dernières [Pg 36]agonies. Il s'embarque, désespéré de ne plus voir Fanny, angoissé à l'idée de laisser son œuvre inachevée, torturé par la pensée que la gloire lui échappe; et, sur le bateau, une fois encore, une seule, une dernière fois il redevient Keats:

... Puissé-je, toujours immobile, toujours immuable,
Elire comme oreiller le sein naissant[73] de ma bien-aimée
Pour le sentir à jamais doucement se soulever, puis s'abaisser,
Eveillé à jamais en une délicieuse insomnie,
Pour entendre encore, et encore, sa tendre respiration
Et vivre ainsi toujours—ou sinon m'évanouir dans la mort[74].
Après un court séjour à Naples, il vient s'installer à Rome, où tout de suite «il sent les marguerites pousser sur lui», puis il termine en retrouvant pendant les derniers jours une sérénité païenne, ce qu'il appelait sa «vie posthume».

Les zoïles d'Edimbourg n'avaient cessé de lui reprocher son affectation archaïque, son obscurité, sa téméraire absence de tout sentiment chrétien aggravée par l'imprudente évocation d'une religion disparue sans retour; et, finalement, lui avaient bienveillamment conseillé de renoncer à la littérature pour reprendre son ancien métier de pharmacien. Jeffrey, plus juste, avait reconnu en lui le don merveilleux de faire revivre le [Pg 37]monde symbolique avec une stupéfiante réalité.

Byron, atteint d'un accès de fureur effrénée en lisant cet éloge, avait écrit à son éditeur Murray:

«Plus de Keats, s'il vous plaît! Ecorchez-le moi tout vif, ou je me chargerai moi-même de lui ôter la peau. Je ne peux supporter l'idiotie ni le rabachage de ce petit singe. J'étais fier des éloges comme des blâmes de Messieurs les critiques d'Edimbourg. Maintenant qu'ils ont bien parlé de Keats, tous ceux qu'ils ont vantés sont déshonorés par cet article insensé».

Le pauvre poète une fois mort, le généreux Lord s'écriera frénétiquement en parlant d'Hypérion: «Ce fragment Titanique, sublime comme Eschyle!» et s'excusera de ses invectives d'antan, en alléguant qu'il avait défendu la mémoire de Pope que l'auteur de «Sommeil et Poésie» s'était permis de flageller.

Tardive, exagérément tardive, se produisit la réaction, puisque le malheureux méconnu ne la connut pas. Des rivaux littéraires—il y a, par chance, des exceptions—plutôt que de témoigner, eux-mêmes, pendant leur vie de simples regrets pour une injustice commise à l'égard d'un vivant, préféreront toujours laisser à leurs successeurs le soin de prodiguer à un mort les honneurs de l'apothéose! Et cette apothéose fut complète: peintres, poètes, musiciens, critiques des générations suivantes, Hood, Tennyson, Morris, Rossetti, O'Shaugnessy, [Pg 38]Marzials, Payne, Swinburne, Burne Jones, Millais, en Angleterre et chez nous Mallarmé, Mœterlinck, Debussy entre autres, recueillirent l'héritage du jeune maître.

La Veille de Saint-Marc[75] surtout devint l'Evangile des Symbolistes. Chez la plupart il est facile de reconnaître les traces de cette fervente admiration dont les conséquences furent le plus souvent heureuses, mais parfois néfastes, il faut l'avouer.

Le grand poète n'avait jamais emprunté leurs sensations à ceux mêmes qui le séduisaient le plus; il s'était, sans exception aucune, adressé invariablement à la nature. Si les sujets antiques l'avaient attiré de préférence, c'est qu'instinctivement il avait deviné que les peuples, dans leur enfance, ont, de toute évidence, et pour cause, des impressions fraîches, que leurs sens ne sont pas émoussés, ni leurs façons de les exprimer tombées dans la banalité. De plus, étant très peu livresque, son amour exclusif de la Forme et de la Beauté lui fournissait une solution satisfaisante pour toutes les énigmes de l'univers. Pour lui, comme pour les Grecs, voir les choses dans leur Beauté c'était les considérer dans leur Vérité:

Beauté, c'est Vérité. Vérité c'est Beauté; voilà tout
Ce que vous savez sur terre, et tout ce qu'il faut savoir[76].
[Pg 39]Du moment qu'on possède en toute assurance son point fixe, son étoile polaire, pourquoi se lancer dans l'inconnu des troubles et des incertitudes?

Tel est le véritable fond de son hellénisme. Par contre, il abomine ceux qu'il intitule les faux classiques, Pope[77] et ses fades imitateurs, auxquels il reproche d'être des artisans de vers, et surtout de pasticher les poètes du xviie siècle français. Il le proclame dès sa première pièce importante, celle qui est, en quelque sorte, sa profession de foi, sa préface de Cromwell:

............ Un schisme
Entretenu par la frivolité et la barbarie
Fut cause que le grand Apollon rougit pour son pays.
Un millier d'artisans portaient le masque
De poètes. Race déshéritée! Race impie!
Qui blasphémaient le brillant lyrique
Et ne s'en apercevaient pas,—non, ils marchaient
Brandissant un misérable étendard décrépit
Sur lequel étaient inscrites les plus falotes devises et en gros caractères.
Le nom d'un certain Boileau[78].......
Il prétend être, lui, un vrai classique, non celui qui se borne à représenter l'idée aussi nue et aussi nette que possible, mais celui qui—outre ces qualités, [Pg 40]apanage de la statuaire—à l'égal des romantiques ses contemporains, continue la tradition de leurs illustres devanciers, les Arioste, les Spenser, les Burns, et, comme les peintres de son pays, montre les objets à travers une atmosphère colorée et irradiante, au milieu d'un halo et d'un vague émouvants.

Beers[79] voit en lui le poète de l'émotion romantique, de même qu'en Scott celui de l'action romantique. C'est le diminuer, les émotions ainsi que les actions romantiques étant en général dénuées de sincérité, parce que, leur amour du Beau ne trouvant pas sa satisfaction dans la vie ordinaire, ils la requéraient dans les événements du passé ou les cataclysmes de la Nature.

Il faut donc aller plus loin que Beers et que Keats lui-même, et dire que, classique par le choix de ses sujets—du moins les plus développés—il s'est montré romantique dans sa forme et naturaliste par la franchise de son impressionnabilité. Voilà sa grande originalité, sur laquelle on ne saurait trop insister, celle qui constitue sa personnalité novatrice à cette date de son siècle: ne traduisant que des sensations directes, il demeure, quand même, actuel, et ne tend jamais à se créer une âme grecque, ni une âme gothique, ni une âme de néo-latin.

[Pg 41]Ce n'est pas ce que comprirent les poètes qui vinrent après lui, lorsque sa gloire fut devenue incontestée. Géographiquement ses principaux poèmes, Endymion, Lamia, Hypérion étaient grecs; son ardent amour pour le paganisme l'avait forcé de se tenir à l'écart de l'évolution scientifique, politique et religieuse qui remplissait d'orgueil ses compatriotes. Ils n'analysèrent pas davantage et estimèrent logique d'en conclure qu'il trouvait son Idéal uniquement dans le passé.

Et cependant, n'avait-il pas, à plusieurs reprises, nettement formulé ses idées sur l'évolution persistante et inéluctable de toutes choses?

Dans Hypérion, au milieu du conseil tenu par les dieux désespérés d'avoir été vaincus par Jupiter, «un enfant», un dieu nouveau, Neptune s'adressant à Saturne lui dit:

De même que le Ciel et la Terre sont plus beaux, beaucoup plus beaux.
Que le Chaos et les Ténèbres vides, quoique rois autrefois,
De même que nous montrons, supérieurs à eux le Ciel et la Terre,
Par la forme, la cohésion et la beauté,
Par la volonté, la liberté, la fraternité,
Et par des milliers d'autres signes d'une vie plus pure;
De même sur nos talons marche une perfection nouvelle,
Un pouvoir d'une beauté plus mâle, né de nous
Et destiné à nous surpasser, autant que nous surpassons
En gloire les antiques Ténèbres; et nous ne sommes pas
[Pg 42]Plus vaincus par eux que ne l'a été par nous la domination
Du Chaos sans forme[80]..........
Etait-ce la théorie d'un artiste s'hypnotisant sur un stade de cette évolution et s'y ankylosant de propos délibéré?

......... De fraîches fleurs écloront
Et de nombreuses gloires marquées au sceau de l'immortalité[81]!
D'autres esprits se tiennent ici à l'écart
Sur le seuil de l'âge qui vient.
Ceux-là, ceux-là donneront au monde un autre cœur
Et d'autres pulsations. N'entends-tu pas le ahan
De puissants travaux dans les humaines entreprises!
Ecoutez un instant, nations, et soyez muettes[82]!
Il espérait donc que la postérité verrait régner le bonheur universel ... ou à peu près.

Les architectes anglais, Inigo Jones et Wren avaient rédigé une sorte de code qui réglementait en principes fixes et arides la riche et indépendante imagination des Hellènes: ils mesuraient, pour chaque ordre, la proportion exacte de la colonne par rapport à son chapiteau, l'élévation de l'entablement par rapport à celle de la colonne; les sculpteurs calculaient quelle dimension précise devait avoir chaque trait de la figure, combien [Pg 43]de fois la hauteur de la tête était contenue dans celle du corps, ils comptaient les plis de chaque Cariatide; tout était ramené à des lois mathématiques et intangibles. Les poètes n'agirent pas autrement et suivirent aveuglément la même fausse route, pensant, très sincèrement, marcher sur les traces de Keats.

Byron, malgré qu'il eût, sans discontinuer, battu en brèche le vieil édifice social et criblé de ses sarcasmes les dévotions désuètes et hypocrites, restait l'idole du gros public.

Wordsworth, qui avait d'abord—et ce fut son grand mérite—protesté éloquemment contre la préférence que les pseudo-classiques professaient pour le général, et remis le concret en honneur, finissait par prêcher sempiternellement; et, s'il restait l'éducateur moral de l'Angleterre puritaine et bourgeoise, il était peu à peu délaissé par le clan des délicats qui lui reprochaient d'être terre à terre.

Shelley, de son côté, admiré surtout, dans la suite, par Tennyson, et une petite élite, était trop grand et dépassait trop ses contemporains pour qu'ils pussent se rendre compte de sa supériorité: tout en s'imprégnant des éléments, au même degré que Keats, il savait, de plus, rajeunir les thèmes antiques, Prométhée par exemple. Enfin Shelley était un philosophe doublé d'un socialiste qui cherchait son Idéal dans l'Avenir.

Keats qui n'avait cure ni de guider les hommes [Pg 44]dans le Présent, ni de les améliorer dans l'Avenir, qui ne s'était jamais soucié que de se poser en champion de la Forme pure, se désignait, en apparence, comme le visionnaire imaginant les rêves les plus éthérés et les plus éloignés des réalités quotidiennes. Par la magie de son style, la nature entière avait resplendi d'un éclat de pierres précieuses et des créatures immatérielles d'une impeccable Beauté avaient été ressuscitées.

Les Préraphaélites ne discernèrent que cette face de son talent; mais n'étant pas doués de la même porosité, ils utilisaient ses sensations parce qu'ils n'en éprouvaient pas de véritablement personnelles. Les maîtres seuls se dégagèrent de cette influence, Swinburne et Browning surtout; les autres, qu'ils prissent leurs sujets chez les classiques Grecs, qu'ils les situassent au Moyen-Age, pendant la Renaissance ou même dans une phase plus récente, demeurent condamnés à n'être jamais considérés que comme des virtuoses, comme des techniciens incomparables, qui, n'infusant dans leurs poèmes ni étincelle, ni vie, exerçaient industrieusement un merveilleux métier.

Grands artistes ils se prouvaient, assurément, et passionnés pour la Beauté, mais artistes dont la volonté de se manifester artistes devenait par trop perceptible! Ils divinisaient les émotions, mais n'étant pas émus eux-mêmes, ils ne frissonnaient pas à l'unisson avec ceux qu'ils côtoyaient chaque [Pg 45]jour, d'où un désaccord flagrant entre leur génie et celui de leur époque. Ils étaient des déracinés!

Au milieu de parcs féériques, ombragés d'arbres laissant retomber sur des pelouses d'émeraude des frondaisons aux reflets métalliques, ils érigent des palais de marbre couronnés de toitures irisées. Les fleurs et les fruits des parterres semblent des améthystes, des topazes, des rubis; les ruisseaux, miroitant comme des saphirs, apportent leur tribut à des bassins du milieu desquels s'élève à des hauteurs prodigieuses une floraison de gerbes d'eau formées du cristal le plus pur. Sur ce décor se profile une profusion de Lucius Vérus avec trop de cheveux en volutes et de barbes en spirales, d'élégantes dames avec trop de corps en ivoire, trop de joues de corail, trop d'yeux de diamant et de dents de perles. Où est l'atmosphère dans ce paysage métallisé et pétrifié? Chaque détail a une égale importance, brille d'un éclat uniforme.

Sans doute les héros de Keats n'agissent pas, mais au moins leur extériorité se transforme-t-elle:

Laissée à elle-même la forme serpentine....
.... se tordit convulsée en des souffrances écarlates
Le jaune safran foncé remplaça
La couleur plus tendre de la lune qui ornait son corps gracieux.
Et, telle la lave dévastant une prairie,
Ternit ses écailles d'argent et ses tresses d'or,
[Pg 46]Obscurcit ses taches fauves, ses stries et ses rayures,
Eclipsa ses croissants, éteignit ses étoiles[83]...
Ses métaux fusent, ses marbres deviennent malléables, ses ondes, comme dans Endymion, prennent tour à tour l'aspect d'un saule pleureur, puis d'un cygne, d'un chêne, d'une cathédrale gothique. Sa Lamia, son Isabelle ne se satisferaient pas de n'avoir en perspective que des enfants sidéraux! Ce n'est pas un évocateur d'âmes dont les essences se modifient, c'est un créateur de formes dont la transmutation et la mobilité sont incessantes. Chez lui, tout est vivant, même le:

Bouclier rougissant du sang des reines et des rois[84].

L'atmosphère est fluide et transparente, et chacun des détails concourt à l'effet d'ensemble.

Pour résumer: ce qu'il a de primesautier et d'inimitable, c'est la subtilité de son odorat, la finesse de son goût, l'acuité de son ouïe, la netteté de sa vision; ce qui est indiscutablement à lui, c'est la qualité de sa sensibilité, sa sincérité en l'enregistrant et sa franchise en l'exprimant. Voilà pourquoi les critiques, se piquant d'idéalisme, ne [Pg 47]pouvaient lui pardonner son sensualisme; voilà pourquoi il était moderne et pourquoi il devançait son époque.

Shelley, qui, dès le début, l'avait jugé à sa valeur, Shelley qu'il avait méconnu en refusant l'hospitalité que le poète lui offrait avec insistance à Pise, eut juste le temps d'écrire sur lui Adonaïs, son ouvrage le plus parfait peut-être, puis mourut on sait de quelle tragique façon. Par une touchante inspiration, bien digne de son grand cœur, il avait choisi pour ce poème la Stance spensérienne que Keats affectionnait particulièrement et dont il s'était servi pour construire la Veille de Sainte Agnès.

Enfin, dernier hommage du poète panthéiste au poète païen, il avait emporté un Eschyle et un Keats pour faire en mer l'excursion dans laquelle il trouva la mort. On eût dit qu'il s'était muni à dessein de ces deux compagnons d'élite en ce moment suprême où il allait entreprendre son voyage à travers cet infini qui l'avait tant hanté, et les avoir toujours avec lui pendant l'Eternité des siècles.

Et, pieusement, ses compatriotes avaient suivi cette indication: les deux jeunes gens morts, Keats à 26 ans, Shelley à 30 ans, reposaient fraternellement, tout près l'un de l'autre, dans le cimetière protestant de Rome, le long des murs Honoriens, à l'ombre de la pyramide de Cestius. Des acanthes et des digitales poussent çà et là; les silhouettes opaques des pins parasols se découpent [Pg 48]sur le bleu velouté des montagnes de la Sabine qui barrent l'horizon; à de rares intervalles, vers le soir, les grêles clochettes de chèvres qu'appelle dans le lointain un pâtre, en sayon de laine et en sandales de drap brun, lancent leurs notes cristallines vers un ciel teinté d'orange et de vermillon; voilà le paysage au milieu duquel se dressaient les deux tombes, séparées par quelques pouces de terrain[85].

Sur celle de Keats est gravée cette inscription composée par le poète lui-même:

«Ci-gît un dont la gloire était écrite sur l'eau».

Infortunée Angleterre, dont les trois plus grands poètes au xixe siècle sont morts en terre étrangère et méridionale! Est-ce simple caprice du hasard? Inconsciemment ou non, ont-ils fui les climats brumeux, et, semblables à Gœthe, ont-ils voulu finir dans la lumière[86]?

DÉDICACE DE LA PREMIÈRE ÉDITION
A Leigh Hunt.

Gloire et Beauté ont disparu;
Car si nous errons aux premières heures du matin,
Nous ne voyons aucun encens en spirales s'élever
Vers l'Est au devant du jour qui sourit:
Aucune troupe de nymphes à la douce voix, jeunes et gaies,
Apportant des épis de froment en des couronnes tressées,
Des roses, des œillets et des violettes, pour orner
L'autel de Flora au début de son mois de Mai.
Mais il reste encore d'autres joies aussi hautes,
Et je bénirai éternellement ma destinée,
De ce qu'à une époque où sous les arbres plaisants
Pan n'est plus imploré, je ressente un plaisir libre,
Un plaisir touffu, en constatant que je pourrais plaire,
Avec cette pauvre offrande, à un homme tel que toi.

Mars 1817.

IMITATION DE SPENSER
I

Maintenant le matin émergeant de son oriental séjour,
Dès ses premiers pas rencontra une verdoyante colline;
Il couronna de flammes ambrées sa crête dénudée,
Puis argenta les limpides cascatelles de son ruisseau;
Oui, jaillissant pur de sa source moussue, suintait goutte à goutte,
Et après un adieu à son lit de fleurs des champs,
Divisé en maints ruisselets, formait un petit lac;
Celui-ci, le long de ses rives, reflétait des berceaux de ramures entrelacées,
Et dans l'espace central, un ciel qui jamais ne s'abaisse.

II

Là le martin-pêcheur voyait son éclatant plumage
Rivaliser avec les brillantes colorations du poisson,
[Pg 54]Dont les soyeuses nageoires et les légères écailles d'or
Dardaient au-dessus de lui, à travers les ondes, un rayon vermeil;
Là le cygne voyait la courbe neigeuse de son cou
Et majestueusement se promenait en ramant;
Ses yeux de jais étincelaient; ses pattes se montraient
Sous les vagues, semblables à l'ébène d'Afrique,
Et sur son dos une fée reposait voluptueusement.

III

Ah! comment décrire les enchantements d'une île
Placée au centre de ce merveilleux lac;
Je pourrais plutôt distraire Didon de sa douleur,
Ou chasser du vieux Lear son amère tristesse:
Certes on ne vit jamais plus admirable site
Parmi tous ceux qui charmèrent les yeux romantiques;
L'île semblait une émeraude scintillant dans l'argent
Des eaux éblouissantes; de même au plus haut de l'éther,
Transperçant les nuées d'un blanc floconneux, rit le ciel céruléen.

IV

Tout autour, le lac baignait luxurieusement
Des pentes de verdure à travers ses vagues miroitantes,
[Pg 55]Qui, ainsi qu'en une gentille amitié
Se ridaient avec délices sur le bord fleuri,
Comme si elles s'efforçaient de recueillir les rougeoyantes larmes
Qui tombaient en profusion des tiges de rosiers!
Peut-être était-ce l'œuvre de son orgueil
Luttant pour jeter sur la grève un joyau
Qui surpassât tous les bourgeons sertis dans le diadème de Flora.

1813–14.
[Pg 56]

A BYRON
Byron que ta mélodie est suave et triste!
Prêtant à l'âme des accords de tendresse,
Comme si la douce Pitié, avec une force inaccoutumée,
Avait touché son luth plaintif, et que toi à ses côtés,
Tu eusses saisi les sons et ne leur eusses pas permis de mourir.
La douleur qui couvre tout ne te rend pas moins
Séduisant: bien que tes chagrins soient revêtus
D'un brillant halo, d'un éblouissant éclat,
Comme lorsqu'un nuage voile la lune dorée,
Et que ses bords sont colorés d'une lumière resplendissante;
A travers la sombre robe, souvent percent des rayons transparents
Qui s'infiltrent comme de jolies veines dans le marbre noir.
Chante encore, cygne agonisant! refais encore le récit,
Le récit enchanteur, le récit du plaisant pitoyable.

1815.
[Pg 57]

A CHATTERTON
O Chatterton! que ton destin fut triste!
Cher enfant du chagrin—fils de la misère!
Combien prématurément les ténèbres de la mort ont éteint tes yeux,
Où le génie mettait une douce lueur et un haut dessein!
Combien prématurément ta voix, majestueuse et inspirée,
Se dissolvait en vers mourants! Oh! combien proche
Fut la nuit de ton admirable matin. Tu mourus
Fleurette à demi épanouie frappée par les souffles glacés.
Mais c'est le passé: te voilà parmi les astres
Au plus haut du ciel: aux sphères qui tourbillonnent
Tu chantes harmonieusement; rien ne gâte tes hymnes,
Au-dessus du monde ingrat et des humaines épouvantes.
Sur terre, l'homme juste défend contre les vils détracteurs
Ton illustre nom et l'abreuve de larmes.

EN OUVRANT POUR LA PREMIÈRE FOIS L'HOMÈRE DE CHAPMANN
J'ai beaucoup voyagé à travers les royaumes dorés,
Et vu maints florissants états et maintes nations;
Autour de maintes îles occidentales j'ai vogué
Dont les bardes restent fidèles au culte d'Apollon.
Souvent on m'avait parlé de la vaste étendue
Qu'Homère au front ridé gouvernait comme son domaine;
Mais jamais encore je n'avais respiré son souffle pur
Avant que Chapman fît résonner son haut et fier langage:
Alors, je me sentis comme un veilleur des cieux
Lorsqu'une nouvelle planète surgit à portée de sa vue,
Ou comme le vaillant Cortez, quand de ses yeux d'aigle
Il fixait le Pacifique—alors que tous ses hommes
Se regardaient avec un étrange soupçon—
Silencieux, du haut d'un pic du Darien.

SONNET
O combien j'aime, par un beau soir d'été
Lorsque des torrents de lumière déversent l'or à l'Occident
Et que sur les zéphyrs embaumés reposent immobiles
Les nuages argentés, loin, très loin, laisser
Les pensées vulgaires, et m'accorder un doux répit
Contre les menus soucis; découvrir après une paisible recherche,
Une solitude parfumée, parée des beautés de la Nature,
Et là, faire délicieusement illusion à mon âme:
Là m'échauffer le cœur avec des chansons de ma patrie,
Méditant sur le sort de Milton—sur le cercueil de Sidney—
Jusqu'à ce que leurs formes austères se dressent devant moi:
Peut-être prendre mon essor sur l'aile de la Poésie,
Très souvent verser une larme délicieuse
Lorsque quelque mélodieuse tristesse enchante mes yeux.
[Pg 60]

A SPENSER
Spenser, un de tes fervents admirateurs,
Qui a pénétré au plus profond des arbres de ta forêt,
Me fit promettre, l'autre soir, de ciseler
Quelques vers dont le charme pût séduire ton oreille.
Mais, Poète Elfe! il est impossible
A un habitant de cette terre hivernale
De s'élever, tel Phœbus, muni d'une plume d'or,
Avec des ailes de flamme et de faire surgir une aube en sa joie.
Il est impossible d'échapper au labeur
Tout d'un coup, et de recevoir ton inspiration;
La fleur doit absorber la nature du sol
Avant de pouvoir s'épanouir:
Sois avec moi dans les jours d'été, et je
Ferai une tentative en ton honneur et pour plaire à cet ami.
[Pg 61]

ÉPITRE A GEORGES FELTON MATTHEW
Douces sont les joies que procure la poésie,
Et doublement douces quand elle chante une fraternité;
Aucun souvenir, Matthew, ne peut évoquer à nos yeux
Un destin plus plaisant, une jouissance plus vraie
Que celui dans lesquels s'ébattent deux Poètes frères,
Qui, en combinant leurs inspirations, emploient leur talent
A élever un trophée aux muses du drame.
La pensée de cette grande association infuse
Dans le cœur aimant du génie, la divination
De tout ce qui est haut, grand, bon et calmant.

SONNET
Combien de bardes dorent le cours du temps!
Quelques uns d'entre eux furent toujours la nourriture
De mon imagination charmée—Je pouvais longuement méditer
Sur leurs beautés, terrestres ou célestes:
Et souvent, lorsque je m'asseois pour rimer,
Elles font en foule irruption dans mon cerveau:
Mais ni confusion, ni trouble grossier
Elles n'apportent; c'est un harmonieux accord.
Ainsi les innombrables sonorités qui sont l'apanage du soir;
Les chants des oiseaux—le bruissement des feuilles—
La voix des eaux—la grande cloche qui se balance
En résonnant solennellement—et des milliers d'autres encore,
Que la distance empêche de reconnaître,
Forment non un vacarme incohérent, mais une délicieuse symphonie.

Avril 1816.
[Pg 63]

A G. A. W.
Nymphe du sourire en dessous et du coup d'œil de côté,
Dans quels plus divins moments de la journée
Es-tu la plus séduisante? Est-ce lorsque, t'écartant des droits chemins,
Tu t'engages dans les labyrinthes des douces paroles?
Ou lorsque avec sérénité tu vagabondes en un ravissement
De pensée plus raisonnable? Ou lorsque, partant au loin
En costume désordonné pour affronter les rayons du matin,
Tu jettes les fleurs éparses dans ta danse vertigineuse?
Peut-être est-ce lorsque tes lèvres de rubis s'entrouvrent délicieusement,
Et restent ainsi parce que tu écoutes:
Mais tu as été éduquée si exclusivement en vue de plaire
Qu'il m'est impossible de dire jamais quelle disposition est la meilleure.
J'aurai aussi vite jugé quelle Grâce plus élégamment
Danse devant Apollon, que résolu cette question.

Avril 1816.
[Pg 64]

O SOLITUDE
O Solitude! si je dois habiter avec toi,
Que ce ne soit pas parmi les entassements confus
De sombres masures! Gravis avec moi le pic escarpé,—
Observatoire de la nature,—d'où le vallon
Avec ses pentes fleuries et le gazouillis cristallin de sa rivière,
Puisse sembler un empan[1]; que je passe tes veillées
Sous des voûtes de branches où le daim, par ses bonds rapides,
Ecarte l'abeille sauvage de la digitale à clochettes.
Mais, quoique je sois heureux d'assister à ces scènes en ta compagnie,
Pourtant, l'aimable causerie avec un esprit naïf,
Dont les propos sont des images de pensées délicates
Est la joie de mon âme; et, sûrement ce doit être
A peu près la plus haute félicité de la race humaine,
Lorsque dans tes retraites se réfugient deux âmes sœurs.

Mai 1816.

Tels sont les plaisirs qui échoient au poète vivant:
Mais plus riche est la récompense de la postérité.
Que murmurera-t-il dans son dernier soupir,
Lorsque ses fiers regards perceront les ténèbres de la mort?

Quant à mes sonnets, quoique personne n'y ait fait attention,
Je me réjouis, cependant, à l'idée que vous les lirez.
Depuis peu, aussi, j'ai éprouvé un grand et paisible plaisir,
Etendu sur le gazon, occupé à ce que j'aime par dessus tout:
A griffonner ces lignes pour vous. Voilà ce que je pensais
Tandis que sur mon visage je sentais la brise la plus fraîche.
En ce moment, je repose sur un lit de fleurs
[Pg 66]Qui couronne une falaise élevée; et celle-ci domine fièrement
Les vagues de l'Océan. Les pédoncules, les brins d'herbe
Strient ma table de leurs ombres tremblotantes.
D'un côté est un champ d'avoines penchées,
Que les coquelicots émaillent de leurs folioles écarlates.
Si choquantes et si inutiles, puisqu'elles rappellent à l'esprit
Les vêtements rouges que déteste l'humanité,
Et de l'autre côté, se déploie devant mes yeux
Le manteau bleu de l'Océan avec des raies pourpres et vertes.
Tantôt j'aperçois un navire avec ses voiles, et tantôt
Je remarque le remous, brillant comme de l'argent, qui enveloppe sa proue.
Je vois l'alouette redescendant vers son nid,
Et la mouette, aux vastes ailes, qui jamais ne se repose;
Car, lorsqu'elle n'étale plus largement ses ailes,
Sa poitrine danse sur la mer inlassablement agitée
.    .    .    .     .    .    .    .     .    .    .    .     .    .    .    .     .    .    .    .    .

ÉCRIT PENDANT UNE SOIRÉE D'ÉTÉ
Les cloches de l'église font résonner les alentours de leur mélancolie,
Elles invitent les fidèles à prier encore,
A se plonger encore dans le noir, dans de plus redoutables soucis,
A écouter plus souvent l'affreuse éloquence d'un prédicateur.
A coup sûr l'esprit de l'homme est étroitement envoûté
Par quelque sombre ensorcellement; on voit chacun fuir
Les joies du foyer, et les airs Lydiens,
Et les entretiens élevés avec ceux que la gloire a couronnés.
Toujours, toujours les cloches sonnent, et j'en sentirais un froid humide
Un frisson comme celui qui émane de la tombe, si je ne savais
[Pg 68]Qu'elles vont mourir, comme une lampe dont l'huile est consumée,
Que c'est leur dernier soupir, leur lamentation avant de rentrer
Dans l'oubli—si je ne savais que de fraîches fleurs écloront
Et de nombreuses gloires marquées au sceau de l'immortalité.

D'après ce qui précède, ami Charles, vous pouvez clairement concevoir
Pourquoi je ne vous ai jamais adressé de vers:
Parce que mes pensées n'étaient jamais nettes ni précises,
Et qu'elles étaient peu dignes de plaire à une oreille classique;
.    .    .    .     .    .    .    .     .    .    .    .     .    .    .    .     .    .    .    .    .
Aussi ne le ferais-je pas maintenant si je ne vous connaissais depuis longtemps;
Si vous ne m'aviez le premier appris tous les charmes du chant:
Le grand, le doux, l'élégant, le libre, le délicat;
Celui qui s'enfle pathétiquement et celui qui va divinement droit;
Les voyelles Spensériennes qui prennent leur essor en toute aisance,
[Pg 70]Et flottent comme les oiseaux sur les mers estivales;
Les tempêtes Miltoniennes, et plus encore, la tendresse Miltonienne;
Michel en armes, et plus encore la charmante gracilité de la tendre Eve.
Qui a lu pour moi le sonnet s'enflant bruyamment
Jusqu'à son apogée, puis mourant fièrement?
Qui a exalté pour moi la grandeur de l'ode,
Tirant, comme Atlas, sa vigueur de son propre poids?
Qui m'a fait goûter plus qu'une liqueur forte
La tranchante épigramme à la pointe aiguisée?
Et m'a prouvé que, de tous, l'épique était le roi,
Sphérique, grandiose, enserrant tout comme l'anneau de Saturne?

SONNET
Piquantes, tumultueuses, les raffales sifflent çà et là
A travers les buissons desséchés, à demi dénudés;
Les étoiles semblent gelées, suspendues dans le ciel,
Et j'ai de nombreux milles à parcourir à pied.
Cependant je m'inquiète peu du froid de la bise glacée,
Ou du lugubre frémissement des feuilles mortes,
Ou de ces lampes d'argent allumées au-dessus de moi,
Ou de la distance qui me sépare du doux repos du home;
Car je suis tout imprégné de l'amitié
Que j'ai trouvée dans le petit cottage,
De l'éloquente détresse de Milton aux cheveux si beaux,
Et de toute son affection pour le gentil Lycidas noyé,
De la charmante Laura dans sa légère robe verte,
Et du fidèle Pétrarque couronné par la gloire.
[Pg 72]

MÊME SONNET TRADUIT PAR SAINTE-BEUVE
Piquante est la bouffée à travers la nuit claire;
Dans les buissons séchés la bise va sifflant;
Les étoiles au ciel font froid en scintillant,
Et j'ai, pour arriver, bien du chemin à faire.
Pourtant je n'ai souci ni de la bise amère,
Ni des lampes d'argent dans le blanc firmament,
Ni de la feuille morte à l'affreux sifflement,
Ni même du bon gîte où tu m'attends, mon frère!
Car je suis tout rempli de l'accueil de ce soir,
Sous un modeste toit où je viens de m'asseoir,
Devisant de Milton, l'aveugle au beau visage,
De son doux Lycidas par l'orage entraîné,
De Laure en robe verte en l'avril de son âge,
Et du féal Pétrarque en pompe couronné.
[Pg 73]

A MES FRÈRES
De petites flammes agitées traversent le charbon dont on vient d'emplir l'âtre,
Et leur léger pétillement se fait entendre au milieu de notre solitude,
Tels des chuchotements de dieux familiers qui gardent
Un affectueux empire sur nos fraternelles âmes.
Et pendant qu'à la recherche de rimes je voyage jusqu'aux pôles,
Vos regards sont fixés, comme en un sommeil poétique,
Sur la légende si abondante et si profonde
Qui toujours, à la tombée de la nuit, apaise nos soucis.
C'est votre jour de naissance, Tom, et je me réjouis
Qu'il se passe ainsi en une reposante quiétude.
Bien des veillées semblables de doux chuchotement
Puissions-nous passer ensemble, et ressentir dans le calme
Ce que sont les vraies joies d'ici-bas—avant que la grande voix
De la céleste bouche, ordonne à nos esprits de prendre notre vol.

18 novembre 1816.
[Pg 74]

SONNET
Pour celui qui a longtemps été parqué dans la ville,
Quelle joie de promener ses regards sur la sereine
Et libre étendue du ciel,—d'exhaler une prière
Sous le plein sourire du firmament azuré!
Qui peut être plus heureux que lui, lorsque d'un cœur satisfait
Il enfonce ses membres lassés dans quelque moelleux tapis
D'herbe drue, et lit une débonnaire
Et poétique histoire d'amour et de langueur?
Quand il rentre chez lui, le soir, son oreille
Perçoit les plaintes de Philomèle, ses yeux
Surveillent la brillante course des nuées qui voguent dans l'espace;
Il se lamente de ce que ce jour se soit si vite écoulé:
Comme la chute d'une larme d'ange
Qui tombe dans le lumineux éther, silencieusement.

1816.
[Pg 75]

EN QUITTANT QUELQUES AMIS DE BONNE HEURE
Qu'on me donne une plume en or, et qu'il me soit permis de m'appuyer
Sur un monceau de fleurs, en des régions claires et lointaines;
Qu'on m'apporte une tablette plus blanche qu'une étoile,
Ou la main d'un ange chantant un hymne, lorsqu'on l'aperçoit
Entre les cordes d'argent d'une harpe céleste;
Qu'ici s'avancent sur de nombreux chars ornés de perles,
Des robes roses, des cheveux flottants, des corbeilles de diamants,
Des ailes à demi découvertes, et des regards perçants.
En même temps, que la musique bourdonne autour de mes oreilles,
Et chaque fois qu'arrivera quelque délicieuse Coda,
Que j'écrive un vers d'une somptueuse tonalité,
[Pg 76]Plein des multiples émerveillements des sphères:
Jusqu'à quelle hauteur en effet mon esprit prétend-il s'élever!
Il n'est pas satisfait de demeurer si tôt seul.

ADRESSÉ A HAYDON
Hauteur d'esprit, jalousie pour tout ce qui est bien,
Une ardente tendresse pour la renommée d'un grand homme,
Habitent çà et là au milieu de cette foule sans nom,
Dans la ruelle infecte, dans le bois inextricable;
Et là où nous pensons que la vérité est la moins comprise,
Très souvent nous trouvons la «sincérité du but»
Qui devrait épouvanter jusqu'à se cacher de honte
Une pitoyable engeance, affamée d'argent.
Combien glorieuse est cette affection pour la cause
Du génie inébranlable, peinant vaillamment!
Qu'arrive-t-il lorsqu'un intrépide champion fait rentrer
L'Envie et la Malice dans leur taudis natal?
D'innombrables âmes font retentir de discrets applaudissements,
Fières de le contempler dans les yeux de sa patrie.

1816.
[Pg 78]

ADRESSÉ A HAYDON
De grands esprits habitent en ce moment sur terre;
Celui du nuage, de la cataracte, du lac,
Qui sur le sommet d'Helvellyn, les yeux ouverts,
Reçoit sa fraîcheur des ailes de l'Archange:
Celui de la rose, de la violette, du printemps,
Du sourire social, du lien pour le salut de la Liberté:
Et là!—de celui dont la fermeté jamais ne devrait prendre
Un son plus humble que le chuchotement de Raphaël.
D'autres esprits se tiennent ici à l'écart
Sur le seuil de l'âge qui vient;
Ceux-là, ceux-là donneront au monde un autre cœur
Et d'autres pulsations. N'entends-tu pas le ahan
De puissants travaux dans les humaines entreprises?
Ecoutez un instant, nations, et soyez muettes!

SONNET
Heureuse est l'Angleterre! je me contenterais
De ne pas voir d'autre verdure que la sienne;
De ne pas sentir d'autres brises que celles qui soufflent
A travers ses imposantes futaies confondues avec les grandioses légendes;
Et cependant, parfois, je sens que je languis
Pour le ciel Italien, que je gémis intérieurement
De ne pas prendre assiette sur une Alpe comme sur un trône,
Et que j'oublie à demi ce que signifient monde et mondanité.
Heureuse est l'Angleterre! suaves sont ses filles dénuées d'artifice;
Suffisant pour moi est leur simple charme,
Suffisants sont leurs bras blancs vous enlaçant en silence:
Et cependant, je brûle souvent, avec ardeur, de voir
Des beautés au regard énigmatique, d'entendre leurs chants,
Et de voguer avec elles sur les eaux estivales.

SUR LA SAUTERELLE ET LE GRILLON
La poésie de la terre ne meurt jamais:
Quand tous les oiseaux abattus par la chaleur du soleil
Se cachent sous la fraîcheur des arbres, une voix courra
De haie en haie le long des prés nouvellement fauchés;
C'est celle de la Sauterellle—qui conduit le concert
Dans la volupté de l'été; inépuisables
Sont ses délices; et, lorsqu'elle est lassée de ses jeux
Elle se repose à l'aise, abritée sous quelque roseau hospitalier.
La poésie de la terre ne cesse jamais:
Par une solitaire soirée hivernale, quand la gelée
A imposé un silence général, dans l'âtre grince
Le cri du Grillon, dont la chaleur augmente l'acuité;
Il semble au dormeur à moitié assoupi
La voix de la Sauterelle parmi les collines herbues.

SONNET
Après que de sombres vapeurs ont pesé sur nos montagnes
Pendant une longue et triste saison, survient un jour
Enfant de l'aimable Sud, qui purge
Les cieux malades de toutes malsaines souillures.
Le mois anxieux, délivré de ses tourments,
Prend comme un droit longtemps perdu le contact de Mai,
Les paupières se jouent avec la fraîcheur qui passe,
Comme les feuilles de rose avec les gouttes des pluies d'été.
Les pensées les plus calmes flottent autour de nous:—les feuilles
Qui bourgeonnent—le fruit mûrissant dans le silence—les soleils d'automne
Souriant le soir sur les paisibles javelles—
La joue duvetée de Sapho—la respiration d'un enfant endormi—
Le sable qui parcourt grain par grain une horloge—
Un ruisselet sous bois—une mort de Poète.

FEMME! LORSQUE JE TE VOIS
Femme! lorsque je te vois bavarde, vaine,
Inconstante, puérile, orgueilleuse et pleine de caprices;
Dénuée de cette modeste langueur qui rehausse le charme
Des yeux baissés, repentants des blessures
Causées par leur douce lueur et les guérissant aussitôt:
Aussitôt mon esprit enfiévré s'exalte et bondit,
Aussitôt mon âme tressaute et se réjouit
De ce que si longtemps je sois resté fermé à l'amour.
Mais quand je te discerne bonne, charitable et tendre,
O ciel! avec quel acharnement j'adore
Ta grâce enchanteresse;—je brûle d'être
Ton défenseur—d'être ton Calidore—
Un vrai Chevalier de la Croix Rouge—un vaillant Léandre—
Pourvu que je sois aimé de toi comme ces héros de jadis!
[Pg 84]Pieds agiles, yeux violet foncé, cheveux bien séparés.
Mains potelées, cou de neige, poitrine blanche,
Sont choses qui stupéfient les sens éblouis
Au point que les yeux fascinés, fixes, oublient qu'ils regardent.
D'un tel spectacle, o Ciel! je n'ai pas le courage
De détourner mon admiration, si dépourvu
Soit-il de ce qui mérite le respect, si dépouillé
De l'adorable modestie et des rares vertus.
Cependant, aussi insouciant que l'alouette, je me dégage
De ces leurres et les oublie immédiatement—même avant d'y avoir goûté
Ou d'avoir trois fois humecté mon palais; mais lorsque je remarque
Que de pareils charmes unissent leur éclat avec celui d'une bienveillante intelligence,
Mon oreille s'entrouvre, telle la gueule rapace d'un requin,
Pour se repaître des accents d'une voix divine.

Ah! qui peut oublier jamais une créature si parfaite?
Qui peut oublier ses attraits à demi dissimulés?
Dieu! elle est comme l'agneau d'un blanc de lait, qui bêle
Pour que l'homme le protège. Assurément Celui qui voit tout,
Qui est heureux de nous savoir satisfaits de ses dons,
Ne donnera jamais d'ailes au criminel qui entraîne
Tant d'innocence à sa ruine—qui vilement dupe
[Pg 85]Un cœur naïf de colombe. Pour dire vrai, rien ne peut libérer
Nos pensées d'une telle beauté: lorsque j'entends
Un lai dont j'ai vu une fois sa main évoquer le rythme,
Son contour me semble flotter palpable et proche;
L'eussé-je jamais vue cueillir d'un berceau
Une fleur trempée de rosée, souvent cette main m'apparaîtrait,
Et sur mes yeux secouerait les perles tremblotantes de l'humidité.
[Pg 86]

A UN AMI QUI M'AVAIT ENVOYÉ DES ROSES
Comme j'errais à travers les champs en liesse,
Alors que l'alouette secoue la tremblante rosée
Qui perle sur le trèfle, son abri—quand à nouveau
Les chevaliers d'aventure se saisissent de leurs boucliers bossués:—
Je vis la fleur la plus délicate que produise la sauvage nature,
Une rose musquée fraîchement épanouie; c'était la première qui distillât
Son parfum sur l'été: gracieuse elle croissait
Semblable à la baguette que manie la reine Titania.
Et comme je me régalais de son odeur,
Je pensais qu'elle surpassait de beaucoup la rose des jardins:
Mais quand, o Wells! tes roses me parvinrent
Mes sens furent délicieusement charmés:
Elles avaient de douces voix, qui plaidaient tendrement
Murmurant les mots de paix, de sincérité et d'amitié indomptable.
[Pg 87]

SUR LES MARBRES D'ELGIN
Mon esprit est trop faible; la hantise de la mort
Pèse lourdement sur moi comme un invincible sommeil,
Et tout pinacle que j'imagine, tout abîme
De divine souffrance me dit que je dois mourir,
Tel un aigle blessé qui regarde le ciel.
Cependant c'est une exquise jouissance de pleurer
De ce que je n'ai pas les vents des nuées à maintenir
Frais pour les yeux qui s'ouvrent au matin.
De telles gloires vaguement conçues dans le cerveau
Font affluer au cœur une ineffable haine.
Ainsi causent une vertigineuse souffrance ces merveilles
Dans lesquelles on trouve mélangée la grandeur Grecque avec la rude
Destruction du vieux Temps—avec une masse agitée
Un soleil, une ombre d'une magnitude.

1817.
[Pg 88]

CONCLUSION DU PRÉCÉDENT SONNET
Haydon! pardonne-moi de ne pouvoir parler
En termes définitifs de ces hauts chefs-d'œuvre.
Pardonne-moi de ne pas avoir les ailes de l'aigle,
De ne pas savoir où je dois chercher ce qui me fait défaut;
Et pense que je ne voudrais pas être par trop naïf
En faisant résonner des roulements de tonnerre répétés
Jusque sur les escarpements d'où jaillissent les sources de l'Hélicon.
Eussé-je un souffle assez puissant pour une tâche aussi fantastique.
Pense aussi que toutes ces harmonies seraient tiennes;
A quel autre seraient-elles? Qui, sur ce sujet, atteint le bord de ton manteau?
Car lorsque les hommes regardaient ce qu'il y a de plus divin
Avec une idiotie écervelée et une suffisance phlegmatique,
Tu avais déjà contemplé le plein éclat Hespérien
De leur splendeur orientale, et tu étais allé les adorer!
[Pg 89]

SUR LA MER
Elle entretient d'éternels murmures autour
De ses rivages désolés, et de son puissant gonflement
Engloutit deux fois dix mille cavernes, jusqu'à ce que le charme
D'Hécate leur abandonne leurs sonores et antiques ténèbres.
Souvent on la trouve d'humeur si paisible,
Que c'est à peine si la plus petite écaille
Sera remuée, pour des jours, de la place où elle est une fois tombée,
Lorsque, la dernière fois, les vents du ciel étaient déchaînés.
O vous! qui avez les prunelles des yeux meurtries et lassées,
Régalez-les devant l'immensité de la mer;
O vous! dont les oreilles sont rassasiées de rudes vacarmes
Ou repues jusqu'à indigestion de fades mélodies,
[Pg 90]Asseyez-vous à l'entrée de quelque vieille caverne, et méditez
Jusqu'à ce que vous tressailliez, comme si les nymphes de la mer chantaient!

SONNET
Quand je crains de cesser d'être
Avant que ma plume ait glané mon fertile cerveau,
Avant qu'une pile élevée de livres, dans leurs caractères imprimés,
Renferme, comme de pleins greniers, une moisson bien mûre;
Quand j'étudie sur la face étoilée de la nuit,
Les vastes symboles nuageux d'un haut poème,
Et sens que je ne vivrai jamais pour retracer
Leurs ombres, avec la main magique de la chance;
Et quand je sens, exquise créature d'une heure!
Que je ne te verrai jamais plus devant moi,
Que je ne savourerai plus l'enchanteur pouvoir
De l'inconscient amour! alors sur la grève
Du vaste monde, je me tiens seul, et je médite,
Jusqu'à ce qu'Amour et Gloire plongent dans le néant.

JE ME HAUSSAIS SUR LA POINTE DES PIEDS[1]
Je me haussais sur la pointe des pieds au sommet d'un côteau.
L'air était rafraîchissant et tellement tranquille
Que les tendres fleurs en bouton qui avec une modeste fierté
Ployaient languissamment, en une courbe infléchie,
Leurs tiges peu garnies de feuilles et coquettement élancées,
N'avaient pas encore perdu leurs diadèmes étoilés
Dérobés aux premiers sanglots du matin.
Les nuages étaient purs et blancs comme des troupeaux nouvellement tondus,
Et sortant d'un clair ruisseau; paisiblement ils reposaient
Sur les champs azurés du ciel; alors se glissa
Un imperceptible frémissement parmi la feuillée,
[Pg 93]Produit par le soupir même qu'exhale le silence;
Car on ne pouvait discerner le plus faible mouvement
De toutes les ombres qui s'allongeaient sur la pelouse.
L'œil le plus glouton pouvait vagabonder au large
Pour regarder la variété de ce qui l'entourait;
Sonder la transparence jusqu'au tréfonds de l'horizon
Et suivre les lignes presque effacées de ses contours;
S'imaginer les bizarres et capricieux méandres
D'une fraîche allée de bois qui ne finit jamais;
Ou d'après les ombreuses crevasses et les pentes feuillues
Deviner où les gracieux ruisseaux se rafraîchissent.
Un instant je regardai, et me sentis aussi léger, aussi libre
Que si d'un mouvement d'éventail les ailes de Mercure
Avaient joué sous mes talons: mon cœur était léger,
Et de nombreuses jouissances surgissaient à mes yeux;
De sorte qu'aussitôt je me mis à composer un bouquet
De splendeurs brillantes, laiteuses, harmonieuses et rosées.

Un buisson de fleurs de Mai avec des abeilles les butinant;
Ah certes! nul recoin plaisant n'en serait dépourvu!
Que le cytise juteux fasse couler sur elles ses grappes,
Que les hautes herbes croissent autour des racines pour les garder
Humides, fraîches et vertes; et ombragent les violettes
Pour qu'elles enlacent la mousse dans le réseau de leurs feuilles.
[Pg 94]

Qui est là proche? une touffe d'onagres,
Au-dessus desquelles peut voltiger l'esprit jusqu'à ce qu'il s'engourdisse;
Au-dessus desquelles il lui est loisible de faire un somme délicieux,
Quoique sans cesse troublé par le jaillissement
De boutons en fleurs mûres, ou par le vol rapide
De diverses phalènes qui abandonnent sans relâche leur lieu de repos,
Ou par la lune élevant son cercle argenté
Au-dessus d'un nuage, et, d'un mouvement graduel,
Plongeant dans le bleu avec tout son éclat.

Au-dessus de nos têtes, nous apercevons le jasmin et l'églantier odorants,
Et les vignes en fleurs se riant de leur verte parure;
Tandis qu'à nos pieds la chanson des bouillonnements de l'eau cristalline
Par son charme nous enlève aussitôt loin de tous nos soucis;
De sorte que nous nous sentons planant au-dessus du monde,
Marchant sur les nuées blanches entrelacées et enroulées.
Ainsi le sentit le premier qui raconta comment Psyché vint
[Pg 95]Poussée par une brise caressante vers des royaumes merveilleux;
Ce que Psyché éprouva, ainsi que l'Amour, lorsque leurs pleines lèvres
Se rencontrèrent pour la première fois; de quelles amoureuses et folles morsures
Ils se meurtrirent les joues; et leurs innombrables soupirs,
Et comment ils baisèrent leurs yeux frémissants:
La lampe d'argent—le ravissement—la surprise—
L'obscurité—la solitude—le redoutable tonnerre;
Leurs épreuves terminées, et l'envolée aux cieux
Où ils s'inclinèrent reconnaissants devant le trône de Jupiter.
C'est ce que sentit celui qui écarta les ramures
Pour nous permettre de sonder la vaste forêt,
D'entrevoir les Faunes et les Dryades
Venant avec le plus doux bruissement au milieu des arbres;
Et des guirlandes tressées de fleurs sauvages et délicates,
Soulevées par les poignets ivoirins ou les pieds agiles:
Il disait comment la belle, la tremblante Syrinx échappa
Au Pan Arcadien, en une mortelle épouvante.
Pauvre Nymphe—pauvre Pan—comment il pleura de ne retrouver
Que l'adorable soupir du vent
Dans les roseaux de la rivière! murmure à peine entendu,
Plein de douce désolation—douleur embaumée.
[Pg 96]Par quelle inspiration le barde des anciens âges chanta-t-il d'abord
Narcisse languissant au-dessus de la source pure?
En quelque délicieux vagabondage, il avait découvert
Une petite clairière entourée de branches entrelacées;
Et, au centre un étang si clair
Que jamais plus clair n'a reflété dans sa plaisante fraîcheur
Le ciel bleu, çà et là tamisant sa sérénité
A travers les pampres grimpants et leurs fantasques festons.
Puis sur la rive il surprit une fleur solitaire,
Une modeste fleur abandonnée, sans aucune fierté,
Penchant sa beauté sur le miroir de l'onde
Pour s'approcher amoureusement de sa propre image attristée.
Sourde au léger Zéphyr, elle restait immobile;
Mais semblait insatiable de se pencher, languir, aimer.
Ainsi tandis que le Poète était fasciné en ce site charmant,
Quelques indistinctes lueurs glissèrent sur sa fantaisie;
Peu de temps après il conta l'aventure
Du jeune Narcisse et l'infortune de la triste Echo.

D'où venait-il celui dont l'esprit ardent exhala
Le plus harmonieux des chants, éternellement nouveau,
Toujours rafraîchissant, pures délices,
Ne cessant de réjouir
Le voyageur au clair de lune? lui apportant
[Pg 97]Des formes du monde invisible et des mélodies surhumaines
Jaillies de l'espace éthéré, des nids fleuris,
Et du soyeux capiton des nuages suspendus
Là où l'on contemple les étoiles.
Oh! sûrement il a brisé nos barrières humaines;
Dans quelque merveilleuse région il a pénétré,
Pour te rechercher, toi, divin Endymion!
C'était un Poète, à coup sûr un amant aussi,
Celui qui hantait le sommet du Latmos, alors qu'y soufflaient
Des émanations parfumées montant des myrtes de la vallée,
Apportant en une pâmoison solennelle, douce et lente,
Un hymne du temple de Diane! pendant que le tourbillon
De l'encens s'enlevait vers sa demeure étoilée.
Mais bien que son visage fût clair comme un regard d'enfant
Bien qu'au-dessus de l'autel elle sourît au sacrifice,
Le Poète pleurait sur sa douloureuse destinée,
Pleurait de ce qu'une telle beauté fût condamnée à la désespérance:
C'est ainsi que son sublime courroux lui inspira des harmonies dorées,
Et qu'il donna la tendre Cynthie à son Endymion.

Reine du vaste espace, ô souveraine la plus charmante
[Pg 98]Entre toutes les splendeurs que mes yeux aient vues!
De même que ton éclat surpasse toutes choses,
De même aucun conte n'atteint la douceur du tien.
Oh! pour trois paroles suaves comme le miel, puissé-je
Raconter une seule merveille de ta nuit nuptiale!

Là où de lointains navires semblent montrer leurs quilles,
Phébus pour un instant arrêta ses puissantes roues
Et se retourna pour sourire à tes yeux timides,
Avant de vouloir solenniser son invisible magnificence.
L'air du soir était si vif, et si transparent,
Que les hommes de bonne santé étaient d'une gaîté inaccoutumée;
S'avançant comme Homère au son de la trompette
Ou le jeune Apollon sur son piédestal;
Et les séduisantes femmes étaient aussi belles et chaudes,
Que Vénus en alarme jetant ses regards de tous côtés.
Les zéphirs étaient purs et éthérés,
Et s'insinuaient à travers les croisées mi-closes pour guérir
Les malades languissants, rafraîchissant leur fiévreux assoupissement
Et les berçant dans un sommeil complet et profond.
Bientôt ils s'éveillaient les yeux clairs: la soif ne les incendiait plus,
Leurs doigts ne brûlaient plus, et leurs tempes n'éclataient plus.
Alors ils se levaient, leur vue causait l'étonnement
[Pg 99]De leurs chers amis, presque fous de joie;
Ceux-ci tâtaient leurs bras et leurs poitrines, les embrassaient et les regardaient fixement,
Et sur leurs fronts calmes séparaient les cheveux.
Jeunes hommes et jeunes filles se regardaient curieusement les uns les autres,
Les mains derrière leurs dos, immobiles, stupéfaits
De voir la lueur réciproque de leurs yeux;
Ainsi ils se tenaient, remplis d'une douce surprise
Jusqu'à ce que leurs langues se déliassent en essor poétique.
Dès lors aucun amoureux ne mourut d'angoisse:
Mais les vers mélodieux prononcés en ce moment
Nouèrent des liens de soie qui ne pussent jamais être brisés.
Cynthia! Je ne peux énumérer les félicités plus grandes
Qui suivirent la tienne, ni les baisers de ton cher berger:
Un poète est-il né alors?—n'ajoutons rien pour l'instant—
Mon esprit vagabond ne doit plus errer davantage.

ÉCRIT AVANT DE RELIRE LE ROI LEAR
O Romance à la Langue-dorée accompagnée d'un doux luth!
Syrène aux beaux ramages! Reine! même lointaine!
Cesse tes mélodies en ce jour d'hiver.
Ferme ton volume vieilli, et sois muette.
Adieu! Une fois encore la lutte farouche
Entre le tourment de l'Enfer et l'argile impassible
M'enflammera; une fois encore j'expérimenterai
L'amère suavité de ce fruit Shakspearien.
Poète Roi! et vous nuées d'Albion,
Créateurs de notre profond et éternel thème,
Quand j'aurai parcouru l'antique forêt de chênes,
Que je ne m'égare pas en un rêve stérile.
Mais lorsque je suis consumé par le Feu,
Donnez-moi les ailes d'un nouveau Phénix pour voler à ma guise.

RÉPONSE A UN SONNET DE REYNOLDS FINISSANT AINSI:
«Les yeux sombres sont plus chers de beaucoup
Que ceux que parodie la clochette de l'hyacinthe.»



Le Bleu! c'est la vie du firmament, le domaine
De Cynthia—le vaste palais du Soleil—
C'est la tente d'Hespérus et de toute sa suite—
Le cœur des nuages, or, gris et brun.
Le Bleu! c'est la vie des eaux—l'Océan
Et tous les fleuves ses vassaux: les lacs innombrables
Peuvent entrer en fureur, écumer, bouillonner, mais ne pourront
Jamais subsister s'ils ont perdu leur originaire teinte bleu foncé.
Oh Bleu! charmant cousin de la forêt verte,
Marié au vert dans les fleurs les plus délicates—
Le «ne m'oubliez pas»—la campanule bleue—et cette reine
[Pg 102]De la modestie, la violette: quelle puissance étrange
Tu possèdes, à l'état de simple ombre! Et combien grande,
Lorsque dans un Œil, par la volonté du Destin, tu es vivant!

A HOMÈRE
Etant à l'écart dans une géante ignorance,
J'entends parler de toi et des Cyclades,
Comme quelqu'un, assis sur le rivage, qui désire ardemment
Pouvoir visiter le dauphin corail dans les profondes mers.
Ainsi tu étais aveugle!—Mais alors le voile était déchiré;
Car Jupiter enlevait les rideaux du ciel pour te permettre de voir,
Et Neptune construisit pour toi une tente d'écume,
Et Pan fit chanter pour toi ses ruches des bois;
Oui, sur les bords de l'obscurité il y a de la lumière,
Et les précipices montrent des prairies qu'on n'a pas foulées;
Il y a un matin en bourgeon dans minuit;
Il y a une triple vue dans une cécité aiguë;
C'est une telle vision que tu possèdes, comme il est arrivé jadis
A Diane, Reine de la Terre, du Ciel et de l'Enfer.

AU NIL
Fils des antiques montagnes Africaines de la Lune!
Torrent de la pyramide et du Crocodile!
Nous t'appelons fertiliseur, juste au moment où
Un désert remplit l'horizon intime de notre vision.
Nourricier de nations basanées depuis l'origine du monde,
Es-tu si généreux? ou leurres-tu
Ces hommes pour qu'ils t'honorent, toi qui, entraîné avec peine,
Les repose pendant l'espace situé entre le Caire et Decan?
Oh! puissent ces imaginations noires se tromper! Elles se trompent sûrement;
C'est l'ignorance qui fait une étendue stérile
De tout ce qui est au delà d'elle. Tu arroses
De verts roseaux, comme nos rivières; et tu goûtes
Le plaisant lever du soleil. De vertes îles tu as aussi,
Et vers la mer tu te hâtes aussi joyeusement.

A REYNOLDS
O toi dont la face a senti le vent de l'Hiver,
Dont les yeux ont vu les nuages de neige suspendus dans la brume
Et les faîtes des ormes noirs au milieu de la froide lueur des étoiles!
Pour toi le Printemps sera un temps de moissons.
Toi dont le seul livre a été la lumière
De l'obscurité suprême, dont tu t'es repu
Nuit après nuit, lorsque Phœbus était au loin!
Pour toi le Printemps sera un triple matin.
Oh! ne t'épuise pas en courant après la science! Je ne sais rien,
Et pourtant mes chants jaillissent naturellement avec la chaleur.
Oh! ne t'épuise pas en courant après la science! Je ne sais rien,
Et pourtant le soir écoute[1]. Qui s'attriste
A la pensée de la paresse ne peut être paresseux,
Et celui-là est éveillé qui pense qu'il est endormi.

OÙ EST LE POÈTE?
Où est le poète? montrez-le! montrez-le,
Vous, les neuf Muses! que je puisse le reconnaître.
C'est l'homme qui en face d'un homme
Est toujours un égal, fût-il un roi,
Qu'il soit le plus pauvre de la tribu des mendiants
Ou n'importe quelle autre chose étonnante
Que puisse être un homme entre un singe et Platon;
C'est l'homme qui, devant un oiseau,
Roitelet ou aigle, trouve le chemin
De tous ses instincts; il a entendu
Le rugissement du lion, et peut dire
Ce qu'exprime sa gorge rugueuse,
Et pour lui le hurlement du tigre
A une signification et frappe
Son oreille comme une langue maternelle.
[Pg 107]

ROBIN HOOD
A un ami.



Non! ces jours sont loin derrière nous,
Leurs heures sont vieilles et grises,
Leurs minutes enterrées toutes
Sous le tapis mortuaire foulé aux pieds
Et formé par les feuilles de nombreuses années!
Bien des fois les grands ciseaux de l'hiver,
Le Nord glacé et l'Est frissonnant,
Accompagnèrent de leurs tempêtes la fête
Des toisons murmurantes de la forêt,
Depuis le temps où les hommes ne connurent ni termes ni rentes.

Non, le bugle ne retentit plus,
Pas plus que l'archet nasillard;
Silencieuse est la perçante flûte d'ivoire
[Pg 108]A travers la bruyère et sur la colline;
Dans le cœur des grands bois s'est tû le rire
Dont l'Echo solitaire renvoie la moitié
A quelque pauvre hère affolé d'entendre
Un éclat joyeux au plus profond de la morne forêt.

Pendant le plus beau temps de Juin
Vous pouvez errer, sous le soleil ou la lune,
Ou les sept planètes pour vous éclairer,
Ou le rayon de la polaire pour vous guider;
Mais jamais vous n'apercevrez
Le petit John ou le vaillant Robin;
Jamais un seul, de tout le clan,
Tambourinant sur une pinte vide
Quelque vieille ballade de chasse, pour
Charmer sa verte promenade en allant
Chez la belle hôtesse Merriment[1],
Dans la vallée, près de l'herbage de Trent;
Car il a abandonné le joyeux conte
Avant-coureur de l'ale épicée.

Disparu, le vacarme de la bachique danse moresque;
Disparue, la chanson de Gamelyn;
Disparu, l'outlaw au ceinturon coriace
Flânant sous la «verte futaie».
Tous sont disparus et passés!
Et si Robin pouvait surgir
[Pg 109]Tout à coup hors de sa tombe de gazon;
Et si Marian pouvait passer,
Une fois encore, ses jours en forêt,
Elle pleurerait, et il deviendrait fou:
Il jurerait; car tous ses chênes
Abattus par les ouvriers de l'arsenal
Se sont pourris dans les ondes salées;
Elle pleurerait de ce que ses abeilles sauvages
Ne chantent plus pour elle—étrange! que le miel
Ne puisse plus être obtenu sans beaucoup d'argent!

C'est ainsi: cependant chantons,
Honneur au vieil arc!
Honneur au cor de chasse!
Honneur aux taillis non coupés!
Honneur au vert Lincoln!
Honneur à l'archer infaillible!
Honneur à l'adroit petit John!
Au cheval sur lequel il galopait!
Honneur au hardi Robin Hood!
S'endormant sous la feuillée!
Honneur à sa fiancée Marian!
Et à tout le clan de Sherwood!
Quoique leurs jours se soient enfuis,
Tous deux entonnons un refrain.

VERS SUR LA TAVERNE DE LA SIRÈNE[1]
—Ames de poètes morts et disparus,
Quel Elysée avez-vous connu,
Riante campagne ou caverne moussue,
Plus raffiné que la Taverne de la Sirène?
Vous êtes-vous enivrés avec boisson plus exquise
Que le vin des Canaries versé par mon hôte?
Ou y a-t-il au Paradis des fruits
Plus savoureux que ces friands pâtés
De venaison? O nourriture généreuse!
Préparée comme si le hardi Robin Hood
Voulait avec sa fiancée Marian,
Festoyer et se griser en vidant corne et canette.
—J'ai entendu dire qu'un beau jour
L'enseigne de mon hôte s'était envolée,
Personne ne savait où, jusqu'à ce que
[Pg 111]La vénérable plume d'un astrologue
A une peau de mouton confiât l'anecdote—
Il raconta vous avoir vus dans votre gloire
Au-dessous d'une vieille enseigne nouvelle
Dégustant un breuvage divin,
Et mettant en gage d'un air satisfait
La Sirène dans le zodiac.
—Ames de poètes morts et disparus,
Quel Elysée avez-vous connu,
Riante campagne ou caverne moussue,
Plus raffiné que la Taverne de la Sirène?

LES SAISONS HUMAINES
Quatre saisons comblent la mesure de l'année;
Quatre saisons se partagent l'esprit de l'homme:
Il a son vigoureux printemps, lorsque sa pure fantaisie
Saisit en tout la Beauté, simplement en étendant la main.
Il a son Eté, lorsque voluptueusement
Récoltant le miel des jeunes pensées printanières, il se plaît
A ruminer, et, en s'élevant dans ces hauteurs de rêve,
Il se rapproche le plus du ciel; de paisibles baies
Abritent son âme en Automne, alors que, les ailes
Etroitement repliées, il se contente de regarder
Les brumes, dans l'oisiveté—de laisser les belles choses
Le côtoyer sans les utiliser plus qu'un ruisseau à sa source.
Il a son Hiver, aussi, de pâle déformation,
Autrement il abdiquerait sa nature mortelle.

FRAGMENT D'UNE ODE A MAÏA
A Raynolds.



Mère d'Hermès! O Maïa toujours jeune!
Puissé-je te dédier un chant
Digne des hymnes qu'on t'a chantés sur les grèves de Baïes?
Ou puissé-je t'invoquer
En vieil idiome Sicilien? Ou tes sourires
Quêter comme naguère ils le furent, dans les îles grecques,
Par des bardes qui moururent heureux sur une riante pelouse,
Laissant des vers grandioses à un petit clan?
Oh! donne-moi leur antique vigueur, n'ayant pour auditeur
Que la paisible primerose, et l'espace
Du ciel et quelques oreilles!
Murmuré par toi, mon chant se mourrait
Heureux comme les leurs,
Riche d'avoir glorifié un seul jour.

EN VISITANT LA TOMBE DE BURNS
La ville, le cimetière, le soleil couchant,
Les nuages, les arbres, les collines environnantes, tout cela semble
Quoique beau, froid—étrange—comme dans un rêve
Que j'ai rêvé, il y a longtemps, et que je viens de reprendre.
Le court et pâle Eté est à peine sorti
Du frisson de l'hiver, pour briller l'espace d'une heure;
Quoique foyers de saphir, leurs étoiles ne scintillent pas:
Tout est froide Beauté; le chagrin ne passe jamais.
Qui, en effet, a le courage de savourer, sage comme Minos,
La réalité de la Beauté, libre de cette teinte de mort
Que l'imagination maladive et l'orgueil malade
Jettent blême sur elle? Burns! avec le respect qui t'est dû,
Je t'ai toujours vénéré. Grande ombre! voile
Ta face; je pèche contre les cieux qui t'ont vu naitre.

OLD MEG
La vieille Meg était une Bohémienne;
Elle vagabondait par les landes,
Son lit était la bruyère roussâtre
Et sa demeure était hors des portes.
Pour pommes elle avait des graines noires,
Pour groseilles des cosses de genêts,
Pour vin la rosée de la sauvage rose blanche,
Pour livre la tombe du cimetière.

Ses frères étaient les rocailleux côteaux
Et ses sœurs les grands mélèzes;
Seule avec sa vaste famille
Elle vivait à sa fantaisie.
Plus d'un matin elle passait sans déjeuner,
Et plus d'une après-midi sans dîner,
Puis, au lieu de souper, elle fixait
La lune, yeux contre rayons.

[Pg 116]Mais, chaque matin, avec le tendre liseron
Elle se composait une guirlande,
Et, chaque nuit, c'était l'if sombre du vallon
Qu'elle entrelaçait, puis se mettait à chanter.
Ensuite de ses doigts vieux et brunis
Elle tressait des nattes de joncs,
Et les donnait aux villageois
Qu'elle rencontrait dans les taillis.

La vieille Meg était brave comme la reine Marguerite,
Et de la taille d'une Amazone.
Un vieux plaid rouge enveloppait son buste,
Un débris de chapeau couvrait son chef.
Que Dieu donne quelque part le repos à ses os âgés!
Elle mourut il y a bien des années passées!

ÉCRIT DANS LA DEMEURE DE BURNS
Ce corps mortel d'un millier de jours
Occupe en ce moment, Burns, une place dans la propre chambre,
Où tu as rêvé seul de lauriers en bourgeons,
Heureux et sans penser au jour fatal!
Mon pouls s'échauffe avec ton propre Barley-bree,
Ma tête est légère pour porter un toast à une grande âme,
Mes yeux sont hagards, et je ne peux pas voir,
Mon imagination est anéantie et enivrée de son but;
Et cependant je peux appuyer mon pied sur ton plancher,
Je peux ouvrir le châssis de ta fenêtre pour découvrir
La prairie que tu as foulée si souvent,—
Et cependant je peux penser à toi jusqu'à m'aveugler la pensée,—
Et je peux boire une rasade en ton nom,—
Oh! souris parmi les ombres, car c'est la célébrité!

STAFFA
Jamais Aladin le magicien
N'entreprit un tel ouvrage;
Jamais la sorcière de la Dee
Ne put voir un tel rêve.
Ni Saint Jean, en l'île de Patmos,
Dans l'ardeur de sa mission,
Lorsqu'il aperçut les sept églises,
Aux nefs dorées, érigées dans le ciel,
N'eut les yeux frappés de l'émerveillement
Que j'éprouvai debout sous sa voûte.
Là! je vis là quelqu'un endormi
Sur le marbre froid et nu;
Pendant que les flots lavaient ses pieds
Et que ses blancs vêtements claquaient,
Trempés, contre les sombres rocs.
Sur sa nuque ses longues mèches
Soulevées, sans être mouillées, au-dessus de la mer
Flottaient sur les vagues comme elles ondulées.
[Pg 119]«Qu'est cela et qui es-tu?»
Chuchotai-je en touchant son front;
«Qui es-tu et qu'est cela?»
Chuchotai-je, et je m'efforçai de baiser
La main de l'esprit, pour éveiller ses yeux.
Il tressaillit à l'instant même:
«Je suis Lycidas, dit-il,
Célèbre par mes chants funèbres.
Cette architecture est l'œuvre
Du grand Océan!—
C'est ici que ses puissantes eaux font vibrer
Tout le jour les orgues caverneuses;
C'est ici que, tour à tour, tous ses dauphins
Pèlerins à nageoires, grands et petits
Viennent payer l'hommage dû,—
Chacun doit faire jaillir des perles de sa bouche!
Plus d'un mortel de ces jours
Ose fouler nos sentiers sacrés,
Ose profaner audacieusement
Cette cathédrale de la mer!
Je fus le pontife souverain
De ce lieu où les eaux jamais ne se calment,
Où le chœur empenné des oiseaux de mer
S'élève à jamais! Le feu sacré
Je le garde caché à tout mortel;
Protée est mon sacristain!
Mais le regard stupide d'un humain
A franchi ce portail de rochers:
Aussi pour toujours fuirai-je
[Pg 120]Ce lieu ainsi souillé, et bientôt
Je le dépouillerai de son enchantement.»
Ce disant, avec la rapidité de l'éclair
L'Esprit plongea!

Cher Reynolds! j'ai un conte mystérieux,
Et ne peux pas le dire; je déchiffre la première page
Sur un roc de Lampit couvert d'algues vertes
Au milieu des brisants; il faisait une soirée tranquille,
Les roches demeuraient silencieuses, la vaste mer roulait
Sans fracas une frange d'écume argentée
Sur une plage unie de sable brun; j'étais chez moi
Et mon bonheur eût été complet—mais je voyais
Trop profondément dans les espaces sous-marins, où chaque estomac,
S'il est le plus fort, se nourrit du plus faible éternellement.—
Mais je pénétrais trop distinctement jusqu'au cœur
D'une éternelle et féroce destruction;
Ainsi du bonheur je m'étais éloigné.
Cette pensée m'obsède encore, et quoique, aujourd'hui,
[Pg 122]J'aie cueilli de jeunes pousses printanières et de joyeuses fleurs
De pervenches et de fraises sauvages,
Je perçois encore cette destruction infiniment féroce:—
Le Requin cruel pour sa proie—le Faucon armé de ses serres,—
Le gentil Rouge-Gorge, tout comme le Léopard et l'Once
Dévorant un Ver,—Arrière, horrible penchants!
Penchants que chacun porte en soi!. . . . . .

D'APRÈS RONSARD
FRAGMENT D'UN SONNET
La nature retint Cassandre dans les espaces éthérés
Pour la parer davantage, un millier d'années,
Elle prit les nuances les plus délicates de leur crème de Beauté,
Et la modela et la colora avec plus de soin que ses pareilles:
Pendant ce temps l'Amour la pressait tendrement dans ses ailes,
Et sous leur ombrage emplissait ses yeux
De tant d'éclat que les royaux habitants des nuages
Du haut Olympe poussaient des soupirs d'esclaves.
Aussitôt que des Cieux je la vis pour la première fois descendre,
Mon cœur prit feu et ressentit de brûlantes douleurs—
Elles furent mes seuls plaisirs—elles furent la triste fin de ma Vie;
L'amour avait infusé sa beauté dans mes ardentes veines...

ENDORMIE
Endormie! oh dors ne fût-ce qu'un moment, blanche perle!
Que je puisse m'agenouiller et prier pour toi,
Et appeler les bénédictions du Ciel sur tes yeux,
Et aspirer l'atmosphère bienheureuse
Qui t'enveloppe et te touche de toutes parts,
Offrandes de mon servage, don de moi-même,
Mon adoration spontanée, mon grand amour!

A UNE DAME QU'IL AVAIT ENTREVUE QUELQUES INSTANTS AU VAUXHAL
La mer de ma vie a été pendant cinq ans à sa marée basse;
De longues heures ont laissé rouler le sable par flux et reflux;
Depuis que je fus enlacé dans les rets de ta beauté,
Que je fus séduit par le dégantement de ta main.
Et maintenant je ne fixe plus le ciel à minuit,
Sans que m'apparaisse la lueur de tes yeux restée vivace en moi;
Jamais je n'admire la couleur d'une rose,
Sans que mon âme prenne son élan vers ta joue;
Il m'est impossible de regarder une fleur en bouton,
Sans que mon oreille passionnée, en pensée à tes lèvres,
Et guettant un amoureux soupir, se rassasie
De sa douceur en sens inverse[1]:—Tu éclipses
Avec ton souvenir toutes les autres délices,
Et mélanges de chagrin mes plaisirs les plus chers.
[1] C'est-à-dire: de son amertume.

[Pg 126]

FANTAISIE
Que toujours puisse vagabonder la Fantaisie,
Le Plaisir n'est jamais au logis:
Au plus doux contact le Plaisir s'évapore,
Telles les bulles d'air assaillies par la pluie.
Que la Fantaisie ailée erre donc
A travers la pensée toujours flottante au dessus d'elle!
Ouvre toute grande la porte de la cage qui emprisonne l'esprit:
Il se précipitera au dehors et volera sous la garde des nuées.
O charmante Fantaisie! mets-là en liberté,
Les joies de l'Eté sont gâtées par l'usage,
Et l'enchantement du Printemps,
Disparaît comme fait sa floraison;
De même les fruits de l'Automne à la peau incarnate
Rougissant au milieu de la brume et de la buée
Rassasient avec l'abus. Que faire alors!
Assieds-toi près de l'âtre, lorsque
[Pg 127]Les fagots pétillants jettent de brillantes flammes.
Esprit d'une nuit d'hiver;
Lorsque la silencieuse terre est recouverte,
Et que la neige durcie est grattée
Par la pesante semelle du valet de charrue;
Lorsque la Nuit se rencontre avec le Midi
En une noire conspiration
Pour bannir le Soir de son Ciel.
Assieds-toi là, et renvoie dehors,
Avec le plus grand respect d'elle-même,
La Fantaisie, investie d'une haute mission: renvoie-là au loin!
Elle a des vassaux, pour la servir:
Elle rapportera, en dépit des frimas
Des beautés que la terre a perdues;
Elle te rapportera, tout ensemble
Toutes les délices d'une température d'été,
Tous les bourgeons et les clochettes de Mai,
Nés dans le gazon humide ou la ramille épineuse;
Toutes les richesses amoncelées de l'automne
En un calme et mystérieux secret.
Elle mélangera ces plaisirs
Tels trois vins savoureux dans une coupe,
Et tu t'en abreuveras;—tu entendras
Distinctement les chants lointains des moissonneurs:
Le bruissement du blé qu'on récolte;
Les oiseaux roucoulant les antiennes du matin:
Et, au même moment—écoutez!
Voici la matinale alouette d'Avril,
[Pg 128]Ou les freux avec leurs coassements affairés
Fourrageant pour recueillir paille et brindilles:
D'un seul coup d'œil, tu reconnaîtras
La marguerite et le souci,
Les lis au blanc duvet, et la première
Primevère des haies qui ait bourgeonné,
L'hyacinthe ombragée, toujours
Reine Saphir de la Mi-Mai;
Puis chaque feuille et chaque fleur
Ornée de sa propre pluie de perles;
Tu verras la souris des champs épier
Décharnée après sa réclusion ensommeillée,
Et le serpent tout maigri par l'hiver,
Dépouillé de sa peau, sur un talus ensoleillé;
Tu verras une nichée d'œufs tachetés
Près d'éclore dans l'aubépine,
Lorsque la femelle demeure les ailes
Immobiles sur son nid moussu;
Puis le tumulte et l'alarme
Lorsque la mouche à miel lance son essaim;
Et la pluie de glands qui tombent
Pendant que siffle la brise d'automne.

O charmante Fantaisie! mets-la en liberté:
Toutes choses sont gâtées par l'usage!
Où est la joie qui ne se fane pas
D'être trop regardée? Où est la vierge
Dont la lèvre mûre est toujours fraîche?
Où sont les yeux, cependant bleus,
[Pg 129]Qui ne se ternissent pas? Où est la figure
Qu'on voudrait rencontrer partout?
Où est la voix, quoique harmonieuse,
Qu'on voudrait entendre très souvent?
Au plus doux contact le Plaisir s'évapore,
Telles les bulles d'air assaillies par la pluie.
Donc, que la Fantaisie ailée
Soit reconnue par toi comme maîtresse de ton esprit
Les yeux riants comme ceux de la fille de Cérès
Avant que le Dieu du Tourment ne lui enseignât
A froncer les sourcils et à gronder;
La taille et les flancs
Blancs comme ceux d'Hébé, lorsque de sa ceinture
Glissa son agrafe d'or, et que sur le sol
Tomba sa jupe à ses pieds
Pendant qu'elle tendait le gobelet d'ambroisie
Et que Jupiter s'alanguissait.—Romps les mailles
Des liens de soie qui retiennent la Fantaisie;
Hâte-toi de rompre la corde qui la lie,
Et elle te rapportera des joies semblables à celle-ci.
Que la Fantaisie ailée puisse vagabonder,
Le Plaisir n'est jamais au logis.

LA VEILLE DE SAINT-MARC
INACHEVÉE
Cela tomba un jour de Sabbath;
Deux fois sainte était la cloche du Sabbath
Qui appelait les fidèles à la prière du soir;
Les rues de la ville étaient propres et nettes
Purgées par les saines averses d'Avril;
Et sur les vitres des croisées, à l'Occident,
Le frileux coucher de soleil parlait tout bas
Des froides vallées d'une verdure sans maturité,
Des haies d'épines vertes sans fleurs,
Des rivières récemment formées avec leurs joncs printaniers,
Des primevères aux berges des ruisselets ombragés,
Et des pâquerettes sur les frissonnantes collines.
Deux fois sainte était la cloche du Sabbath:
Les silencieuses rues étaient encombrées
De groupes graves et pieux, encore
[Pg 131]Imprégnés de la chaleur de leurs oratoires;
Ils se dirigeaient de l'air le plus réservé
Vers les chants du soir et la prière de vêpres.
Chaque porche cintré, chaque porte basse
Etait plein d'une lente et patiente foule,
Chuchotant à mi-voix, traînant les pieds,
Tandis que résonnait l'orgue bruyant et doux.
Les cloches avaient cessé, les prières commençaient,
Et Bertha n'avait pas même lu la moitié
D'un curieux volume rapiécé et déchiré,
Qui, tout le long du jour, depuis la première heure,
Avait retenu captifs ses deux yeux,
Au milieu de ses broderies d'or.
Une multitude de choses l'avaient rendue perplexe:—
Les étoiles du Ciel, les ailes des anges,
Les martyrs dans des torrents de flammes,
Les saints azurés et les rayons argentés,
Les tables sur la poitrine de Moïse, et les sept
Candélabres que Jean vit dans le Ciel,
Le lion ailé de Saint-Marc,
Et l'Arche d'Alliance,
Avec ses nombreux mystères,
Le Chérubin et la souris d'or.

Bertha était une gracieuse fille
Habitant sur la place de la vieille cathédrale;
Du coin de son âtre elle pouvait voir,
De profil, sa vénérable splendeur,
Aussi bien que les murs de l'Archevêché;
[Pg 132]Où les sycomores et les ormes élevés
Couverts de feuilles, dépouilles des forêts,
N'étaient jamais glacés par le vent froid du Nord,
Etant abrités par cette masse imposante.
Bertha se leva, et lut un instant,
La tête appuyée contre la vitre de la fenêtre.
Elle fit un nouvel effort, puis un autre encore
Jusqu'à ce que le crépuscule jetât son obscurité
Sur la légende de Saint-Marc.
Hors de sa colerette de linon, plissée, délicate et légère,
Elle souleva son menton doux et chaud,
Le cou endolori, les yeux noyés,
Eblouie par les saintes images.

Tout était sombre et silencieux,
Sauf de temps à autre le bruit des pas
D'un retardataire rentrant chez lui,
Dont l'écho en passant résonnait devant le parvis de l'église.
Les bruyantes corneilles qui tout le jour
Croassent du sommet des arbres et des tours,
Par couples étaient revenues à leur nid,
Ayant toutes élu domicile dans l'ancien beffroi
Où elles s'endormaient parfois
Au son des musiques et des carillons berceurs.
Tout était silencieux, tout était sombre
Au dehors et au dedans de la chambre:
Elle s'assit, pauvre âme déçue!
Puis alluma une lampe aux charbons presque éteints,
[Pg 133]Penchée en avant, sa brillante chevelure pendant,
Et le livre incliné, en plein devant la clarté.
Son ombre en une attitude guindée
Vacillait de ci, de là, démesurément agrandie
Sur les poutres du plafond et la vieille chaise de chêne,
Sur la cage du perroquet et le panneau carré,
Et l'écran brûlant placé en angle
Sur lequel étaient dessinés un nombre infini de monstres
Appelés colombes de Siam, souris de Lima,
Et des oiseaux de Paradis sans pattes,
Un ara, et le tendre Avadavat
Et l'Angora à la soyeuse fourrure.
Sans se lasser elle lisait, et son ombre toujours
S'étendait, comme si elle voulait remplir
La pièce de ses formes et de ses silhouettes les plus fantasques,
Comme si quelque dame de pique fantôme
Etait venue ricaner derrière son dos,
Danser et faire voltiger ses noirs vêtements.
Sans se lasser elle lisait la légende
De Saint-Marc, de son enfance à son âge mûr,
Sur terre, sur mer, enchaîné par les païens,
Trouvant son bonheur dans ses nombreux tourments.
Quelquefois le docte ermite,
Avec une astérisque d'or, ou la flèche indicatrice,
Renvoyait à de pieuses poésies
Ecrites avec la plus fine plume de corbeau
En dessous du texte, de telle sorte que la rime
Etait éparpillée de temps en temps:
[Pg 134]—«Il écrivit aussi sur l'état de perdition
Dans lequel se trouvait l'homme avant de s'éveiller dans la béatitude,
Quand ses amis le croyaient enseveli,
Sous terre, dans un beau suaire plissé;
Et comment un petit enfant pouvait être
Un saint avant sa naissance,
Etant donné que sa mère (que Dieu la bénisse!)
Se gardât dans la solitude,
Et embrassât dévotement la sainte Croix.
Sur l'amour de Dieu et la puissance de Satan
Il écrivit, et sur bien d'autres choses,
De douces choses que je ne peux citer.
Mais je dois en vérité parler
Quelque peu de sainte Cécile,
Et surtout de ce qu'il a écrit
Sur la vie de saint Marc et sur sa mort:»

A la fin ses regards se fixèrent
Sur le fervent martyr,
Puis en dernier lieu sur sa sainte châsse
Elevée au milieu des cierges étincelants
A Venise,—

A FANNY
I[1]

Nature guérisseuse! laisse mon esprit saigner!
Que mon cœur se soulage en composant des vers et que je trouve le repos;
Lance-moi sur ton trépied, jusqu'à ce que la marée montante
De vers qui m'étouffent déborde de ma poitrine trop pleine.
Un thême! un thême! grande nature! donne-moi un thême;
Que je commence mon songe!
Je viens.—Je te vois telle que tu te tiens ici,
Ne me renvoie pas dans l'air glacial.

[Pg 136]II

Ah! mon plus cher amour! doux sanctuaire de mes craintes,
De mes espoirs, de mes joies, de mes misères haletantes.—
Cette nuit, si je peux deviner, ta beauté montre
Un sourire si délicieux,
Aussi brillant, aussi éblouissant,
Que lorsque avec des yeux ravis, douloureux, asservis,
Perdu dans une douce extase
J'admire, j'admire!

III

Qui, en ce moment, de ses regards gloutons, dévore mon festin?
Quels yeux effrontés dévisagent en ce moment ma lune argentée?
Ah! que du moins ta main ne soit saisie par personne;
Laisse, laisse les amoureux se consumer—
Mais, je t'en supplie, ne détourne pas,
Sitôt de moi, l'élan de ton cœur.
Oh! conserve, par charité
Les pulsations les plus rapides pour moi.

[Pg 137]IV

Conserve-les pour moi, doux amour! quoique la musique souffle
De voluptueuses visions dans l'atmosphère embrasée,
Lorsque tu tourbillonnes au milieu des dangereux festons de la danse;
Sois comme un jour d'Avril,
Souriante, et froide, et gaie,
Un lis tempéré, aussi tempéré que beau;
Alors, Ciel! il y aura
Pour moi un Juin plus ardent.

V

Mais, ceci—vous le direz, ma Fanny, n'est pas vrai!
Mettez votre mignonne main sur votre sein de neige
Là où le cœur bat: confessez,—ce n'est pas nouveau—
Une femme ne peut-elle pas être
Une plume sur la mer,
Ballottée çà et là au gré des vents et des marées?
Ayant une direction aussi incertaine
Que la balle rebondissant dans la prairie?

[Pg 138]VI

Je le sais—et le savoir, c'est se désespérer
Pour quelqu'un vous aimant comme je vous aime, douce Fanny!
Quelqu'un dont le cœur bat pour vous en tous lieux,
Qui lorsque vous rôdez au loin
N'ose pas rester dans sa misérable demeure,
Aimer, aimer seul, ses tristes, ses innombrables souffrances:
Chérie entre toutes! Evitez-moi
Les tortures de la jalousie.

VII

Ah! si vous estimez que mon âme subjuguée vaut plus
Que le pauvre, le passager, le bref orgueil d'une heure,
Que personne ne profane mon Saint-Siège d'amour,
Qu'une main grossière ne rompe pas
Le gâteau sacramentel:
Que personne autre ne touche la fleur encore en bourgeon
Sinon—que mes yeux se closent,
Amour! dans leur dernier repos!

Février 1819.
[1] Keats, pour cette pièce ainsi que pour plusieurs autres, n'a pas numéroté les strophes. Mais, dans une traduction il arrive que, certains vers étant beaucoup trop longs, quelques mots sont rejetés à la ligne suivante; en sorte que, sans cet artifice typographique, il serait difficile de discerner, du premier coup d'œil, l'ensemble de chaque strophe.

[Pg 139]

ODE
Bardes de Passion et de Joie,
Vous avez laissé vos âmes sur cette terre?
Avez-vous aussi des âmes au ciel,
Menant une double vie en des régions nouvelles?
Oui, et celles du ciel communes
Avec les sphères du soleil et de la lune;
Avec le bruit de fontaines merveilleuses,
Et le son d'éclats de tonnerre;
Avec le chuchotement d'arbres célestes
Et une autre, en paisible liberté
Assise sur les pelouses Elyséennes
Broutées seulement par les faons de Diane;
Au-dessous de larges clochettes bleues, habitant
Là où les marguerites ont la senteur des roses;
Où la rose elle-même possède
Un parfum qui n'existe pas sur terre,
Où le rossignol lance, non
Des vocalises sans suite, dans le délire,
[Pg 140]Mais la divine vérité mélodieuse;
Des vers philosophiques harmonieux,
Des contes et des récits dorés
Sur le ciel et ses mystères.

—Ainsi vous vivez au ciel, et cependant
Sur terre vous vivez aussi.
Et les âmes que vous laissez derrière vous
Nous enseignent ici-bas le chemin qui conduit près de vous,
Là où vos autres âmes sont dans l'allégresse,
Jamais engourdies, jamais rassasiées.
Ici votre âme terrestre parle encore
Aux mortels, des menus faits de la semaine:
De leurs chagrins et de leurs joies,
De leurs passions et de leurs haines,
De leur gloire et de leur honte,
De ce qui fortifie et de ce qui guérit.
Ainsi vous nous enseignez chaque jour
La sagesse, bien que vous planiez au loin.

—Bardes de Passion et de Joie
Vous avez laissé vos âmes sur terre!
Avez-vous aussi des âmes au ciel
Menant une double vie en des régions nouvelles?

Mars 1819.
[Pg 141]

SONNET
Pourquoi ai-je ri cette nuit! Aucune voix ne le dira:
Ni Dieu, ni le Démon de sévère réplique,
Ne daigne répondre du Ciel ou de l'Enfer.
Alors vers mon cœur d'homme je me tourne aussitôt.
Cœur! Toi et Moi sommes ici, tristes et solitaires;
Je demande, pourquoi ai-je ri? O mortel souci!
O Ténèbres! Ténèbres! dois-je me lamenter sans fin,
Pour interroger en vain Enfer, et Ciel, et Cœur[1].
Pourquoi ai-je ri? Je connais la durée de l'Etre;
Ma fantaisie lui prodigue ses extrêmes remerciements.
Encore voudrais-je à cette heure même de minuit cesser d'être,
[Pg 142]Et voir ces fastueuses insignes du monde réduites en lambeaux;
Poésie, Gloire et Beauté sont éclatantes, c'est vrai,
Mais la mort est plus éclatante encore—la mort est la haute récompense de la Vie.

19 mars 1819.
[1] Dans l'original les trois mots anglais commencent par un H. Nous avons essayé de rendre, faiblement hélas! cet effet avec les trois E répétés. Mais il manque encore l'aspiration.

[Pg 143]

ODE A UN ROSSIGNOL
I

Mon cœur souffre, une torpeur accablante s'empare
De mes sens comme si j'avais bu de la ciguë,
Ou vidé une coupe de puissant narcotique
A l'instant même et m'étais plongé dans le Léthé:
Ce n'est pas par envie de ton heureux destin,
Mais parce que je suis enivré de ton bonheur,—
Toi, qui, Dryade ailée des arbres,
Dans quelque mélodieux entrelacs
De hêtres verts et d'ombrages infinis
Chantes à plein gosier le calme de l'été.

II

Oh! qui me donnera une gorgée d'un vin
Longtemps refroidi dans la terre profonde,
[Pg 144]D'un vin qui sente Flora et la campagne verte,
La danse, les chansons provençales et la joie ensoleillée!
Oh! qui me donnera une coupe pleine du chaud Midi,
Pleine du véritable, du rougissant Hippocrène,
Avec, sur le bord, des bulles d'écume bouillonnante,
Que, la bouche teinte de pourpre,
Je puisse m'abreuver et, fermant les yeux sur le monde,
M'égarer avec toi dans l'obscurité de la forêt:

III

Disparaître dans l'espace, me dissoudre, oublier
Ce qu'au milieu des bois tu n'as jamais connu,
Le dégoût, la fièvre et l'agitation,
Parmi les hommes qui s'écoutent gémir les uns les autres;
Où le tremblement secoue les vieux aux rares cheveux gris,
Où la jeunesse devient blême, puis spectrale, et meurt;
Où rien que de penser remplit de tristesse
Et sur les paupières pèse d'un poids de plomb,
Où la Beauté ne peut conserver un jour ses yeux lumineux,
Sans qu'un nouvel Amour le lendemain en ternisse l'éclat!

[Pg 145]IV

M'égarer loin! car je veux voler vers toi,
Non pas traîné par les léopards de Bacchus,
Mais sur les ailes invisibles de la Poésie,
Malgré les obstacles et les retards de la sottise:
Déjà je me sens avec toi! tendre est la nuit,
Et peut-être la Lune Reine est-elle sur son trône,
Au milieu de son essaim d'étoiles Fées;
Mais ici, il n'y a nulle clarté,
Sauf celle que le ciel souffle avec les brises
Sur les sombres feuillages et la mousse des sentiers sinueux.

V

Je ne peux même pas discerner les fleurs à mes pieds,
Ni quelles essences d'arbres dégagent d'aussi suaves senteurs,
Mais, dans la pénombre embaumée, je devine l'odeur spéciale
Dont ce mois de la saison parfume
Le gazon, le hallier, le fruit de l'arbre sauvage;
La blanche aubépine et l'églantine des champs;
[Pg 146]La violette qui se fane si vite recouverte par les feuilles;
Et la fille aînée de la Mi-Mai,
La rose musquée en bouton, trempée de rosée vineuse,
Où ronronnent les mouches par les soirs d'été.

VI

Debout dans la nuit, j'écoute et plus d'une fois
J'ai été presque amoureux de la mort apaisante,
Je lui ai donné de doux noms en plus d'un vers pensif,
Pour qu'elle enlevât dans l'air mon souffle calme;
Maintenant plus que jamais il semble délicieux de mourir,
De finir à minuit sans souffrance
Pendant qu'au dehors tu répands ton âme
Dans une telle extase!
Tu chanterais encore; moi, j'aurais des oreilles qui n'entendraient pas—
Ton sublime Requiem résonnerait sur un tertre de gazon.

VII

Mais toi, tu n'es pas né pour la mort, immortel Oiseau!
Il n'y a pas de générations affamées pour te fouler aux pieds;
La voix que j'entends cette nuit fut entendue
[Pg 147]Dans les anciens jours par empereurs et manants:
Peut-être cette même chanson fit tressaillir
Le triste cœur de Ruth, lorsque regrettant sa patrie,
Elle se tenait en larmes parmi les blés de l'étranger;
Peut-être est-ce toi-même qui souvent as
Charmé de magiques fenêtres, s'ouvrant sur l'écume
Des mers périlleuses, en de féeriques terres délaissées.

VIII

Délaissé! Ce mot même semble une cloche
Qui sonne la séparation et me rend à la solitude!
Adieu! l'imagination ne parvient pas à me leurrer autant
Que sa réputation le proclame, décevant elfe.
Adieu! Adieu! ton antienne plaintive va s'affaiblissant,
Il franchit la prairie voisine, le silencieux ruisseau,
Le sommet de la colline, puis s'anéantit dans les profondeurs
De la vallée prochaine.
Etait-ce une vision, était-ce un rêve?
La musique s'est envolée:—Suis-je éveillé, suis-je endormi?

Avril 1819.
[Pg 148]

ODE SUR UNE URNE GRECQUE
I

O toi! fiancée encore inviolée de la quiétude,
O toi! nourrisson du silence et des lentes heures,
Rhapsode sylvestre, qui peux chanter
Un conte fleuri plus harmonieux que nos vers:
Quelle légende enveloppe tes contours d'une frange feuillagée?
Est-elle de divinités ou de mortels, ou des deux,
Dans la vallée de Tempé ou les gorges d'Arcadie?
Quels dieux ou quels hommes sont là? Quelles vierges résistent?
Quelle folle poursuite? Quelle lutte pour échapper?
Quelles flûtes sont là? Quels tambourins? Quelle sauvage extase?

[Pg 149]II

Les mélodies entendues sont douces, mais celles qu'on n'entend pas
Sont plus douces encore; donc, suaves pipeaux, continuez de jouer:
Non pour l'oreille sensuelle, mais des ballades plus chéries,
Des ballades pour l'esprit, sans sonorités!
Bel éphèbe, sous ces arbres, tu ne peux quitter
Ta chanson, pas plus que les arbres ne quittent leurs feuilles;
Audacieux amoureux, jamais, jamais tu n'obtiens les baisers,
Quoique tu sois proche du but—cependant, ne te chagrine pas;
Elle ne peut se flétrir, quoique tu n'atteignes pas ton bonheur,
A jamais tu aimeras, et elle sera belle!

III

Ah! heureux, heureux rameaux! qui ne pouvez perdre
Vos feuillages, ni jamais dire au printemps adieu;
Et toi, heureux mélodiste, jamais lassé,
[Pg 150]Modulant à jamais des chants qui ne vieillissent jamais;
Plus heureux amour, plus heureux, heureux amour!
Que l'on peut goûter sans cesse, à jamais chaud,
A jamais haletant, à jamais jeune;
Soupirant bien au-dessus de toute passion humaine,
Qui laisse le cœur repu et plein d'amertume,
Le front brûlant et la langue desséchée.

IV

Quels sont ces gens allant au sacrifice?
Vers quel autel verdoyant, ô prêtre mystérieux,
Conduis-tu cette génisse qui mugit aux cieux,
Ses flancs soyeux tout parés de guirlandes?
Quelle petite ville sur une rivière ou sur le bord de la mer
Ou bâtie sur une montagne avec une paisible citadelle,
Est vide de cette foule en cette pieuse matinée?
Et toi, petite ville, tes rues à jamais
Demeureront silencieuses; et pas une âme, pour dire
Pourquoi tu es déserte, ne peut revenir jamais.

V

O chef-d'œuvre Attique! contours si purs qu'étroitement
Enserrent une race d'hommes et de vierges de marbre,
[Pg 151]Des branches des forêts et des herbes foulées;
Forme silencieuse, ta hantise dépasse notre pensée
Comme fait l'éternité: Froide Pastorale!
Quand la vieillesse consumera cette génération,
Tu resteras, au milieu d'autres douleurs
Que les nôtres, une amie de l'homme, à qui tu dis:
«Beauté, c'est Vérité, Vérité, c'est Beauté»—, voilà tout
Ce que vous savez sur terre, tout ce qu'il vous faut savoir.

Avril 1819.
[Pg 152]

ODE A PSYCHÉ
I

O Déesse! écoute ces harmonies sans rythme, expression
D'une douce contrainte et d'un cher souvenir.
Et pardonne-moi de murmurer tes secrets
Même à ta propre oreille à la conque délicate:
Sûrement ai-je rêvé aujourd'hui, ou ai-je vu
L'ailée Psyché de mes yeux éveillés?
J'errais, ne pensant à rien, dans une forêt
Lorsque soudain, défaillant de surprise,
J'aperçus deux belles créatures, étendues côte à côte
Dans l'herbe la plus touffue, sous le dais bruissant
Des feuilles et des tremblantes floraisons, là où court
Un ruisselet, à peine visible.

II

Parmi les silencieuses fleurs, aux fraîches racines, aux taches parfumées
Bleu, blanc d'argent, aux boutons pourpres de Tyr,
[Pg 153]Elles reposent, la respiration calme, sur le jeune gazon;
Leurs bras et leurs ailes s'enlacent;
Leurs lèvres ne se touchaient pas, mais ne s'étaient jamais dit adieu,
Comme si, disjointes par la caressante main du sommeil,
Elles étaient prêtes encore à dépasser le nombre des baisers échangés
Lorsque tendrement l'amour ouvre les yeux du matin[1]:
L'enfant ailé je le reconnus.
Mais qui étais-tu, o heureuse, heureuse colombe?
Sa Psyché! elle-même!

III

O la dernière née et de beaucoup la plus aimable vision
De toute la hiérarchie évanouie de l'Olympe!
Plus belle que l'étoile de Phœbé entourée de saphirs
Ou que Vesper, l'amoureux ver luisant du ciel;
Plus belle qu'eux, quoique tu n'aies aucun temple,
Ni autel enguirlandé de fleurs,
Ni chœurs de vierges exhalant de délicieuses litanies
Aux heures de minuit;
Ni voix, ni luth, ni pipeau, ni suave encens
[Pg 154]Fumant d'un brûle-parfum balancé avec des chaînes;
Ni châsse, ni bocage, ni oracle, ni fiévreuse
Incantation psalmodiée par un prophète aux pâles lèvres.

IV

O toi, la plus brillante! quoique venue trop tard pour d'antiques offrandes,
Trop, trop tard pour la lyre ingénûment croyante,
Lorsque sacrés étaient les rameaux des forêts hantées.
Sacrés l'air, l'eau et le feu;
Pourtant, même en ces jours si éloignés
Des heureuses piétés, tes ailes resplendissantes,
S'agitant parmi les Olympiens évanouis,
Je les vois, et je chante inspiré par mes propres visions.
Donc, souffre que je sois ton chœur et que j'entonne une litanie
Aux heures de minuit;
En l'honneur de ta voix, ton luth, ton pipeau, ton suave encens
Fumant d'un brûle-parfum balancé avec des chaînes;
Ta châsse, ton bocage, ton oracle, ta fiévreuse
Incantation psalmodiée par un prophète aux pâles lèvres.

V

Oui, je serai ton prêtre, et te construirai un temple
Dans quelque région inexplorée de mon esprit,
[Pg 155]Où mes pensées, telles des ramures, nouvellement jaillies d'une délicieuse douleur,
En guise de pins, murmureront dans le vent.
Loin, loin alentour, ces arbres groupés dans l'ombre
Garnissent de pic en pic les sauvages déclivités de la montagne;
Et là, zéphyrs, torrents, oiseaux et abeilles,
Endormiront par leurs berceuses les Dryades vêtues de mousse,
Puis, au cœur de cette vaste quiétude,
Je veux édifier un sanctuaire rose
Avec les treillis entrelacés de mon cerveau en travail,
Avec des bourgeons, des clochettes, et des étoiles innommées,
Avec toute la flore que peut simuler la Fantaisie,
Qui créant des fleurs,—ne créera jamais les mêmes;
Et là il y aura pour toi toute la joie apaisante
Qu'une pensée chimérique peut procurer,
Une torche étincelante, et une baie ouverte la nuit
Pour permettre au chaud Amour de s'y introduire.

Avril 1819.
[1] Plus littéralement: au tendre premier clignement d'œil de l'amoureuse Aurore.

[Pg 156]

ODE SUR LA MÉLANCOLIE
I

Non, non, ne te plonge pas dans le Léthé, ne pressure pas
L'aconit, aux racines serrées, pour recueillir son jus empoisonné;
Ne laisse pas ton front pâle subir le baiser
De la belladone, raisin vermeil de Proserpine;
N'égrène pas comme un rosaire les baies de l'if,
Que ni l'escarbot, ni la phalène de mort ne soit
Ta plaintive Psyché, ni le duveteux hibou
Ton partenaire dans les mystérieuses souffrances;
Car ombres sur ombres surviendront aussi assoupissantes
Et étoufferont l'angoisse en éveil dans ton âme.

[Pg 157]II

Mais lorsqu'un accès de mélancolie tombera
Soudain du ciel, telle une pleurante nuée
Qui revivifie chaque fleur dont la tige s'incline,
Et couvre la verdoyante colline de sa parure d'avril;
Alors assouvis ton désespoir sur une rose du matin,
Ou sur l'arc-en-ciel de la grève salée,
Ou sur l'opulence des globuleuses pivoines;
Ou si ton amante témoigne quelque délicieux courroux,
Emprisonne sa douce main, et laisse-la extravaguer;
Et rassasie-toi pleinement, pleinement, de ses incomparables regards.

III

Elle demeure avec la Beauté—la Beauté qui doit mourir;
Et la Joie, dont la main est toujours à ses lèvres
Faisant un signe d'adieu; et près d'elle le douloureux Plaisir
Se changeant en poison au fur et à mesure que l'abeille le suce:
Oui, dans le temple même de la jouissance,
La Mélancolie voilée a son autel souverain
[Pg 158]Que seul peut voir celui dont la langue énergique
Peut écraser le raisin de la Joie contre son palais délicat;
Son âme goûtera la tristesse de sa puissance
Et sera suspendue parmi les trophées des nuages.

ODE SUR L'INDOLENCE
I

Un matin, j'aperçus devant moi trois figures,
Les cils inclinés, les mains jointes, de profil;
Et l'une derrière l'autre elles marchaient sereines
Sur de molles sandales, en de blanches robes gracieusement drapées.
Elles passaient, telles des figures sur une urne de marbre,
Lorsqu'elles la contournent pourvoir l'autre côté.
Elles revinrent, comme si, une fois de plus, l'urne
Avait été tournée; les premières ombres vertes réapparurent,
Et elles étaient étranges pour moi, comme il peut advenir
Avec les vases, pour quiconque ayant approfondi l'art de Phidias.

[Pg 160]II

Comment se fait-il, Ombres! que je ne vous aie pas reconnues?
Comment êtes-vous venues ainsi enveloppées sous cette muette forme?
Etait-ce un complot tacite, savamment dissimulé
Pour me dérober, et me laisser sans occupation
Mes jours de paresse? Avancée était l'heure assoupissante;
La bienheureuse nuée de l'estivale indolence
Engourdissait mes yeux; mon pouls diminuait de plus en plus;
La douleur n'avait plus d'aiguillon, et la guirlande de plaisir plus de fleurs,
Oh! pourquoi ne pas vous être dissoutes et ne pas avoir laissé mes sens
Sans hantise aucune, si ce n'est celle—du néant?

III

Une troisième fois encore elles passèrent, et en passant, tournèrent
Chacune leur face, l'espace d'un moment, vers moi;
Puis elles disparurent; et pour les suivre, ardent
Et haletant, je souhaitais des ailes parce que je reconnaissais les trois.
[Pg 161]La première était une belle jeune fille, qui s'appelait l'Amour;
La seconde était l'Ambition, les joues pâles,
Toujours aux aguets, les yeux caves.
La dernière, ma préférée, celle qui le plus de blâme
Accumula sur sa tête, jeune fille sans pitié,
Je la reconnus pour mon démon, c'était la Poésie.

IV

Elles disparurent, et en vérité! je n'avais pas d'ailes:
O folie! qu'est l'Amour? et où est-il?
Et quant à cette pauvre Ambition! elle fait naître
Dans le cœur de l'homme un court accès de fièvre.
Mais la Poésie!—non—elle n'offre pas une joie—
Du moins pour moi—aussi attrayante que les après-midi assoupissantes,
Et les soirées plongées dans une indolence aussi suave que le miel;
Oh! pour un temps ainsi abrité contre l'ennui,
Puissé-je ne jamais savoir comment changent les lunes,
Ou entendre la voix du bon sens affairé!

V

Encore une fois de plus elles revinrent;—hélas! pourquoi?
Mon sommeil avait été brodé de rêves diffus;
[Pg 162]Mon âme avait été une clairière sur laquelle se déversaient
Confusément, fleurs, ombres mouvantes, et rayons mensongers:
Le matin était nuageux, mais aucune ondée ne tombait,
Quoique fussent suspendues à ses cils les douces larmes de Mai.
La fenêtre ouverte pressait une vigne aux feuilles nouvelles,
Laissait pénétrer la chaleur productrice de bourgeons et le chant de la grive.
O ombres! c'était le moment de vous dire adieu!
Sur vos robes je n'avais pas répandu de larme.

VI

Ainsi, vous trois, Fantômes, adieu! Vous ne pouvez redresser
Ma tête couchée dans la fraîcheur du gazon fleuri;
Car je ne voudrais pas être nourri d'éloges,
Agneau favori dans une farce sentimentale!
Disparaissez graduellement de mes yeux; une fois de plus, soyez
Des figures de masque sur l'urne de rêve;
Adieu! j'ai toujours eu des visions pour la nuit,
[Pg 163]Et pour le jour, les visions qui s'effacent ne manquent pas;
Evanouissez-vous, Fantômes! hors de mon esprit indolent,
Fondez-vous dans les nuages et ne revenez jamais plus!

Printemps 1819.
[Pg 164]

UN SONGE
Après une lecture de l'Episode du Dante, Paulo et Francesca.



De même qu'autrefois Hermès emprunta la légèreté de ses plumes
Lorsqu'il berçait Argus déjoué, pâmé, endormi;
De même sur un chalumeau Delphique mon esprit oisif
Amusa, charma, conquit, priva
De ses cent yeux, le dragon monde;
Et le voyant assoupi, s'envola de même—
Non vers le mont Ida, avec ses nuages chargés de neige,
Non vers Tempé où Jupiter un jour se lamenta—
Mais vers ce second cercle du sombre enfer,
Où parmi les rafales, les tourbillons et les averses
De pluie et de grêle, les amoureux n'ont pas besoin de dire
[Pg 165]Leurs tourments. Pâles étaient les douces lèvres que je vis,
Pâles les lèvres que je baisai, et enchanteresse la forme
Que j'étreignis en flottant au milieu de cette lugubre tempête.

18 avril 1819.
[Pg 166]

LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCY[1]
Ah! qui peut te faire souffrir, être infortuné,
Errant pâle et solitaire!
Les joncs sont desséchés au bord du lac,
Aucun oiseau n'y chante.

Ah! qui peut te faire souffrir, être infortuné,
Si farouche et si malheureux?
Le grenier de l'écureuil est rempli,
Et la moisson est rentrée.

Je vois un lis sur ton front
Avec la moiteur de l'agonie et la buée de la fièvre;
Et sur la joue une rose qui se flétrit
Et se fane de même rapidement.

[Pg 167]J'ai rencontré une dame, dans les prés,
D'une grande beauté—la fille d'une fée;—
Ses cheveux étaient longs, ses pieds légers
Et ses yeux sauvages.

Je l'assis sur mon coursier paisible
Et ne vis rien d'autre tout le long du jour;
Car elle se penchait de côté et chantait
Une chanson de fée.

Je tressai une guirlande pour sa tête,
Puis des bracelets et une ceinture qui embaumait;
Elle me regardait comme si elle m'aimait
Et poussait un doux gémissement.

Elle trouva pour moi des racines d'un goût exquis,
Du miel sauvage et la manne de la rosée;
Et sûrement en langage étrange elle me dit:
Je t'aime véritablement.

Elle m'entraîna dans sa grotte d'elfe;
Là, me contemplant, elle poussa un profond soupir:
Là, je fermai ses yeux sauvages et tristes—
Et l'embrassai jusqu'à l'endormir.

Là nous sommeillâmes sur la mousse,
Et là, je rêvai, ah! malheur véritable!
Le dernier rêve que j'aie jamais rêvé,
Sur le flanc de la froide colline.

[Pg 168]Je vis des rois pâles et des princes aussi,
De pâles guerriers—tous avaient la pâleur de la mort,
Et criaient: «La belle Dame sans Mercy
Te tient en servage!»

Je vis leurs lèvres affamées, dans les ténèbres,
Grandes ouvertes pour me donner cet horrible avertissement;
Et je m'éveillai et me retrouvai ici,
Sur le flanc de la froide colline.

Et voilà pourquoi je reste ici
Errant pâle et solitaire:
Bien que les joncs soient desséchés au bord du lac,
Et qu'aucun oiseau ne chante.

28 avril 1819.
[1] D'après Alain Chartier.

[Pg 169]

SUR LA GLOIRE
Combien fiévreux est l'homme qui ne peut jeter les yeux
Sur ses jours mortels avec un sang calme,
Qui froisse toutes les feuilles du livre de sa vie,
Et dépouille son beau nom de sa virginité;
De même la rose se cueillerait elle-même,
Ou la prune mûre s'enlèverait sa fleur bleutée,
De même une Naïade, tel un elfe maladroit,
Assombrirait la clarté de sa grotte d'une fangeuse obscurité;
Mais la rose émerge de l'églantier
Pour baiser les aquilons et nourrir les reconnaissantes abeilles,
Et la prune mûre demeure revêtue de sa buée;
Pourquoi donc l'homme, importunant le monde pour une grâce,
Risquerait-il son salut pour une croyance erronée et excessive?

30 avril 1819.
[Pg 170]

SUR LA GLOIRE
La gloire, telle une vierge entêtée, demeurera prude
Envers ceux qui la courtisent avec des genoux trop serviles;
Mais elle se livre à quelque garçon irréfléchi,
Et surtout raffole d'un cœur insouciant;
C'est une Gypsie—qui n'adressera pas la parole à ceux
Qui n'ont pas appris à être heureux sans elle;
Une coquette à l'oreille de laquelle on n'a jamais chuchoté de près,
Qui pense qu'on médit d'elle dès qu'on en parle;
C'est une véritable Gypsie, née sur les bords du Nil,
Belle-sœur de la jalouse Putiphar;
Vous, Bardes ivres d'amour! rendez-lui mépris pour mépris;
Vous, Artistes éperdus d'amour! fous que vous êtes!
Tirez-lui votre meilleure révérence et dites lui adieu,
Alors, si cela lui convient, elle vous suivra.

avril 1819.
[Pg 171]

SONNET
Si par de plaies rimes notre Anglais doit être asservi,
Si, telle Andromède, le délicat Sonnet
Doit être enchaîné, en dépit de sa douloureuse beauté,
Essayons de découvrir si nous devons être contraints
Avec des sandales plus compliquées de liens et de forme,
De chausser le pied nu de la Poésie;
Inspectons la lyre, calculons la résonnance
De chaque corde, et voyons ce qui peut être gagné
Par une oreille industrieuse et une patiente attention;
Avares du son et de la syllabe, non moins
Que Midas de son invention, soyons jaloux
De la couronne de feuilles mortes tressée avec le laurier;
Donc, si nous ne pouvons pas laisser sa liberté à la Muse,
Elle sera liée par ses propres guirlandes.

STANCES
(Tirées de la Gazette littéraire, 1829.)



I

En Décembre aux lugubres nuits,
Trop heureux, heureux arbre!
Tes branches jamais ne se rappellent
Leur verte félicité;
Le vent du Nord ne peut les détruire
En les traversant de son sifflement endormeur,
Ni les givres glacés ne les engluent assez
Pour obstruer les bourgeons du printemps.

II

En Décembre aux lugubres nuits,
Trop heureux, heureux ruisseau!
[Pg 173]Tes bouillons jamais ne se rappellent
L'aspect estival d'Apollon;
Mais, en un doux oubli
Ils arrêtent les frémissements de leur onde cristalline,
Jamais, jamais ne s'encolérant
Parce qu'il gèle.

III

Ah! pût-il en être ainsi pour maintes
Filles et maints garçons aimables!
Mais y en eut-il jamais qui ne furent pas
Torturés par les plaisirs passés?
Constater le changement et en sentir la souffrance,
Lorsqu'il n'est personne qui vous en guérisse.
Et que les sens ne sont pas engourdis pour l'ignorer,
N'a jamais été exprimé en vers.
[Pg 174]

CHANSONS DE FÉES
I

Ne verse pas de larmes! oh n'en verse pas!
La fleur s'épanouira une autre année.
Ne pleure pas! oh ne pleure pas davantage?
Les bourgeons naissants sommeillent dans le cœur blanchissant de la racine.
Sèche tes yeux! oh sèche tes yeux!
On m'a appris en Paradis
A calmer mon cœur avec des mélodies—
Ne verse pas de larme.

Au-dessus de ta tête! Regarde au-dessus?
Parmi les fleurs blanches et roses—
Regarde en haut, en haut. Voilà que je voltige
Sur cette branche de rougissante grenade!
Vois moi! C'est ce croissant d'argent
Qui guérit toujours la souffrance de l'homme bon.
Ne verse pas de larme! oh n'en verse pas!
La fleur s'épanouira une autre année.
[Pg 175]Adieu, adieu!—Je m'envole, adieu!
Je m'évapore dans le bleu du ciel—
Adieu! adieu!

II

Ah! malheur à moi! pauvre être ailé d'Argent!
Il me faut chanter la mélopée funèbre de ta dame,
Et sa mort en ce féerique séjour de printemps,
De mélodie, de ruisseau aux rives fleuries,—
Pauvre être ailé d'Argent! ah! malheur à moi!
Il me faut voir
Les fleurs de neige sur le drap funèbre de ta dame!
Va gentil page, à son oreille
Murmure que l'heure est proche.

Doucement dis lui de ne pas redouter
Une sépulture si paisible et si favonienne![1]
Va gentil page! et dis lui tout bas,—
Les fleurs sont suspendues par un charme passager,
Elles tomberont avant que l'étoile cligne trois fois
Sur ses yeux clos,

Qui maintenant versent en vain leurs dernières larmes
En quittant la douce vie et ses verdoyants bocages,—
Fastueux don de l'Esprit des Sphères,—
Hélas! Pauvre Reine!
[1] Exposée aux vents d'Ouest: si saine.

[Pg 176]

ODE A L'AUTOMNE
I

Saison de brume et de féconde abondance,
Proche parente du soleil qui dore;
Contribuant avec lui à charger et à combler
De fruits les vignes qui courent le long des toits de chaume;
A courber sous le poids des pommes les arbres moussus du cottage,
A mûrir jusqu'au cœur tous les fruits;
A grossir les courges, à gonfler les coques des noisettes
D'un succulent noyau; à faire bourgeonner davantage
Et davantage encore, les dernières fleurs pour les abeilles,
Au point de leur faire croire que les jours chauds ne cesseront jamais,
Tant l'Eté a rempli jusqu'au bord leurs visqueuses alvéoles.

[Pg 177]II

Qui ne t'a pas vue souvent parmi tes récoltes?
Parfois qui cherche au dehors peut te trouver
Assise nonchalamment sur le plancher d'un grenier,
Les cheveux mollement soulevés par le souffle du van:
Ou sur un sillon à moitié moissonné profondément assoupie,
Engourdie par l'exhalaison des pavots, tandis que ta faucille,
Epargne l'andain le plus proche et, toutes ses fleurs entrelacées:
Et parfois, comme une glaneuse tu restes
La tête chargée, bien droite, en franchissant un ruisseau;
Ou près d'un pressoir à cidre, d'un patient regard
Tu surveilles les dernières cuvées, heure par heure.

III

Où sont les chants du printemps? Hélas, où sont-ils?
N'y pense plus, tu as ton harmonie aussi—
Pendant que les nuages striés teintent le déclin graduel du jour
Et colorant d'une nuance rose le chaume des plaines;
[Pg 178]Alors, en un chœur plaintif, les petits moucherons zézaient
Autour des saules du fleuve, remontant dans l'atmosphère
Ou redescendant, suivant que la brise légère s'élève ou meurt;
Et les agneaux déjà grands bêlent haut parqués sur le coteau,
Les grillons des haies chantent; à son tour en trilles mélodieux
Le rouge-gorge siffle d'un jardin enclos;
Et les hirondelles se rassemblant gazouillent dans les cieux.

Automne 1819.
[Pg 179]

SONNET
La journée a disparu, disparues sont toutes ses douceurs!
Voix suave, lèvres suaves, douce main et sein plus doux encore,
Souffle chaud, léger soupir, tendre murmure,
Yeux brillants, forme accomplie et taille langoureuse!
Effacée est la fleur et tous ses charmants bourgeons,
Effacée la vue de la beauté hors de mes regards,
Effacée la forme de la beauté hors de mes bras,
Evaporés la voix, la chaleur, la blancheur, le paradis.—
Tout s'est évanoui prématurément au crépuscule,
Lorsque sombre le jour de fête—ou que la nuit de fête
De l'Amour sous les rideaux parfumés, commence à tisser
La trame d'épaisses ténèbres, qui cache ses délices;
Mais comme tout le long du jour j'ai lu le Missel de l'Amour,
Il me laissera dormir, voyant que je jeûne et que je prie.

1819.
[Pg 180]

A FANNY
J'implore votre merci—pitié—amour!—oui, l'amour!
L'amour miséricordieux qui n'excite pas les désirs,
Qui n'a qu'une pensée, ne vagabonde jamais, l'amour sincère,
Sans masque, et quand il se montre—sans aucune tache!
Oh! que tout cela soit à moi,—tout—soit mien!
Cette forme, cette beauté, cette douce, cette légère marque
D'amour, votre baiser,—ces mains, ces yeux divins.
Ce sein brûlant, éclatant de blancheur, prometteur de mille plaisirs,—
Vous même—votre âme—par pitié donnez-moi tout.
Ne me refusez pas un atome d'atome, ou je meurs,
Ou, si je vis, peut-être, votre esclave infortuné
Oubliera, plongé dans une langoureuse détresse,
Le but de son existence—le palais de mon esprit
Perdant son goût, et mon ambition aveugle!

1819.
[Pg 181]

SON DERNIER SONNET
Ecrit sur un exemplaire des Poèmes de Shakespeare donné à Severn quelques jours avant.



Astre brillant! puissé-je, immobile comme tu l'es—
Non pas, resplendir à l'écart suspendu dans la nuit,
Et surveiller, les paupières éternellement redressées,
Tel un forçat de la Nature, Ermite sans sommeil,
Les eaux mouvantes, dans leur tâche lustrale,
Purifiant de leur ablution les rivages des hommes,
Ou contempler le masque floconneux, que, fraîchement tombée,
La neige impose aux montagnes et aux bruyères,—
Non,—mais, puissé-je, toujours immobile, toujours immuable,
Posséder comme oreiller le sein mûrissant de ma bien aimée,
Pour le sentir à jamais doucement se soulever puis s'abaisser,
[Pg 182]Eveillé à jamais en une délicieuse insomnie,
Pour entendre encore, et encore, sa tendre respiration,
Et vivre ainsi toujours—ou sinon m'évanouir dans la mort![1]

1820.
[1] Autre texte:

«A moitié apaisé, ainsi m'évanouir dans la mort!»

POÈMES
[Pg 184]

[Pg 185]

SOMMEIL ET POÉSIE
Quoi de plus suave que la brise estivale?
Quoi de plus charmeur que le subtil ronronnement
Qui se pose une seconde sur une fleur épanouie,
Et bourdonne gaiement de bocage en bocage?
Quoi de plus paisible qu'une rose musquée fleurissant
Dans une île verdoyante complètement ignorée des hommes?
De plus salubre que les vallées ombreuses?
De plus mystérieux qu'un nid de rossignols?
De plus serein que la contenance de Cordélia?
De plus fertile en visions qu'une fière épopée?
C'est toi, Sommeil, qui clos délicatement nos yeux!
Qui fredonnes à voix basse de tendres berceuses!
Qui voltiges léger autour de nos moelleux oreillers!
Qui entrelaces les bourgeons de pavots, et les saules pleureurs!
Qui silencieusement emmêles les cheveux d'une beauté!
Le plus fortuné des écouteurs! lorsque le matin te bénit
[Pg 186]D'avoir donné la vie à tous les yeux en joie
Dont l'éclat sourit à l'aurore nouvelle.

Mais qu'y a-t-il de plus élevé que toi par delà la pensée?
Plus frais que les fruits de l'arbre de la montagne?
Plus étrange, plus beau, plus suave, plus royal
Que les ailes du cygne, que les colombes, les aigles à peine entrevus?
Qu'est-ce? Et à quoi la comparerai-je?
Elle a une auréole, et rien d'autre ne peut l'égaler:
La pensée en est haute, et douce, et sacrée,
Elle chasse toute folie, toute frivolité;
Survenant parfois comme de redoutables coups de tonnerre,
Ou de sourds grondements des régions souterraines;
Et parfois comme un gentil chuchotement
De tous les secrets de quelqu'étonnante chose
Dont le souffle nous enveloppe dans l'atmosphère vide;
De sorte que nous jetons autour de nous des regards curieux,
Peut-être pourvoir des formes de lumière, des peintures aériennes,
Et saisir les flottantes harmonies d'une hymne faiblement perceptible;
Pour voir, suspendue dans les cieux, la couronne de lauriers
Qui doit couronner nos noms lorsque nous serons morts.
Parfois cela prête une magnificence à la voix,
Et du fond du cœur retentit: réjouis-toi! réjouis-toi!
[Pg 187]Paroles qui montent jusqu'au Créateur de toutes choses.
Puis s'évanouissent au loin en d'ardents murmures.

Celui qui a contemplé une fois le soleil dans sa gloire
Et les nués du ciel, et senti son cœur purifié
Par la présence du Souverain Maître, celui-là seul saura
Ce que je veux dire et sentira son être s'embraser:
Donc je n'insulterai pas son esprit
En disant ce qu'il voit par don de naissance.

O Poésie! c'est pour toi que je tiens ma plume
Moi qui ne suis pas encore un glorieux citoyen
De ton vaste Empyrée. M'agenouillerais-je plutôt
Sur quelque pic montagneux jusqu'à ce que je sente
Une réchauffante splendeur rayonner autour de moi,
Et renverrais-je l'écho de ta propre voix?
O Poésie! c'est pour toi que je saisis ma plume
Moi qui ne suis pas encore un glorieux citoyen
De ton vaste Empyrée; pourtant exauce mon ardente prière,
Que de ton sanctuaire me parvienne un air limpide,
Imprégné, pour m'intoxiquer, des effluves
De fleurissantes baies, qui me fassent mourir
De volupté, et que mon jeune esprit suive
Les premières lueurs matinales vers le Grand Apollon
Comme une victime sans tache; ou si je peux supporter
Les accablantes ivresses, elles me suggéreront les féeriques
Visions de tous les espaces: un recoin ombragé
[Pg 188]Sera mon élysée—un livre éternel
D'après lequel je copierai maintes chansons exquises
Sur les feuilles et les fleurs—sur les jeux
Des nymphes dans les bois et les sources; et l'ombre,
Sentinelle silencieuse auprès d'une vierge endormie;
Et maintes poésies d'une si étrange inspiration
Que nous nous demanderons toujours où et comment
Elles naquirent. Des fantaisies aussi planeront
Autour de mon foyer et peut-être y découvriront
Des horizons de solennelle beauté, là où j'ai erré
Dans un bienheureux silence, comme le ruisseau vagabond
Qui franchit la vallée déserte, où j'ai trouvé soit un lieu
D'ombre majestueuse, soit une grotte enchantée,
Soit une colline verdoyante couverte d'une parure diaprée
De fleurs, où intimidé par tant de charmes
J'ai écrit sur mes tablettes tout ce que me permettait
Notre sensibilité humaine, tout ce qui s'accordait avec elle.
Alors j'avais embrassé les événements de ce vaste monde
Comme un géant robuste, et mon esprit fut en travail
Jusqu'à ce qu'il pût avec orgueil constater à ses épaules
Des ailes qui l'emporteraient vers l'immortalité.

Arrête-toi et réfléchis! la vie n'est qu'un jour;
Une fragile goutte de rosée dans sa périlleuse descente
Du sommet d'un arbre; le sommeil d'un misérable Peau-Rouge
[Pg 189]Tandis que sa pirogue se précipite vers les monstrueux tourbillons
De Montmorenci. Pourquoi gémir si tristement?
La vie est l'espoir de la rose non encore épanouie;
La lecture d'un conte qui change éternellement;
Le léger soulèvement du voile d'une vierge;
Un pigeon tournoyant dans l'air transparent de l'été;
Un écolier rieur, sans crainte ni souci
A cheval sur les branches souples d'un orme.

Oh! pour dix ans, que je puisse m'abîmer
Dans la poésie; que je puisse accomplir l'œuvre
Que mon âme s'est imposée.
Alors je traverserai les campagnes que j'aperçois
En longue perspective, et sans me rassasier
Je m'abreuverai à leurs sources pures. Je parcourrai d'abord le royaume
De Flora et du vieux Pan; je dormirai sur l'herbe,
Me nourrirai de pommes rouges et de fraises,
Et choisirai chaque plaisir que percevra ma fantaisie;
Je surprendrai les nymphes aux blanches mains dans les sites ombreux
Pour mendier les doux baisers de leurs faces détournées—
Jouer avec leurs doigts, faire courir sur leurs blanches épaules
Un délicieux frisson avec une morsure
Aussi dure que les lèvres la peuvent donner: jusqu'à ce que je sois agréé,
[Pg 190]Nous lirons un aimable conte de la vie humaine.
Une nymphe enseignera à une colombe apprivoisée comment elle pourra
Le mieux m'éventer gentiment tandis que je dors;
Une autre se courbant dans sa démarche preste,
Couvrira sa tête d'une verte écharpe flottante,
En même temps qu'elle dansera avec une grâce toujours nouvelle
Souriant aux arbres et aux fleurs:
Une autre m'excitera toujours et toujours
Avec des fleurs d'amandiers et la capiteuse cannelle,
Jusqu'à ce qu'au sein du monde feuillu
Nous reposions en silence, comme deux gemmes enroulées
Dans les replis d'une écaille de perle.
Pourrai-je jamais dire adieu à ces joies?

Oui, je dois les laisser de côté pour une vie plus noble,
Où je puisse trouver les agonies, les luttes
Des cœurs humains: car Io! je discerne au loin
Fendant les espaces bleus et escarpés, un char
Et ses coursiers aux crinières en désordre—le conducteur
Surveille les vents avec une glorieuse anxiété:
Et voilà que leurs nombreux piétinements tremblent légèrement
Le long de l'arête d'une énorme nuée, voilà qu'avec rapidité
Ils descendent en tournoyant dans des cieux plus frais
[Pg 191]Tout frangés de l'argent reflété par les yeux brillants du soleil.
Ils glissent de plus en plus bas en vaste tourbillon;
Et maintenant je les aperçois sur les flancs d'une verte colline
Dans un bienfaisant repos, parmi les tiges inclinées.
Le conducteur, avec de merveilleux gestes, s'adresse
Aux arbres et aux montagnes; là bientôt apparaissent
Des formes de joie, de mystère, de crainte
Qui passent devant l'ombre
Projetée par de puissants chênes; comme si elles poursuivaient
Quelque mélodie sans cesse fuyante, ainsi elles balaient l'air.
Io! comme elles murmurent, rient, sourient et pleurent:
Les unes, la main levée et la bouche sévère;
D'autres, la figure couverte jusqu'aux oreilles
Par leurs bras croisés; les unes épanouies en jeune floraison
Vont allègres et souriantes à travers le sombre espace,
D'autres regardent derrière, d'autres au-dessus d'elles;
Oui, des milliers, de mille façons différentes
Volent en avant—tantôt c'est un gracieux feston de jeunes filles
Qui dansent les cheveux luisants, les boucles emmêlées;
Tantôt ce sont de larges ailes. Très ému et très attentif
Celui qui dirige ses coursiers est penché en avant
Et semble écouter: Oh! puissé-je savoir
[Pg 192]Tout ce qu'il écrit avec une telle hâte, avec une telle ferveur.

Les visions se sont toutes envolées—le char a fui
Dans le ciel transparent, et à leur place
Un sens des choses de la vie me pénètre doublement intense,
Et, comme un torrent fangeux, entraînerait
Mon âme vers le néant; mais je lutterai
Contre tous les doutes, et conserverai vivace
Le souvenir de ce même char et de l'étrange
Chemin qu'il parcourut.

A-t-elle si peu de champ
La force de l'humanité de notre époque, que la haute
Imagination ne peut y voler en liberté
Comme c'était jadis son habitude? préparer ses coursiers,
Les lancer contre la lumière et perpétrer d'étranges exploits
Au-dessus des nuages? Ne nous a-t-elle pas tout dévoilé?
Depuis le limpide espace de l'éther, jusqu'au léger
Souffle des nouveaux bourgeons s'entr'ouvrant? depuis la signification
Des larges sourcils de Jupiter, jusqu'à la tendre verdure
Des prairies en Avril? Ici son autel resplendissait
Dans cette île même; et qui pourrait égaler
Le chœur fervent qui éleva un bruissement
D'harmonie, jusqu'aux sommets où il balancera sans fin
Sa puissante essence de sons tourbillonnants,
[Pg 193]Vaste comme une planète et comme elle virant
Eternellement au milieu d'un vide vertigineux?
Ah! dans ces jours les Muses étaient ardemment caressées
Et honorées; il n'y avait alors pas d'autre souci
Que de chanter et de lisser leurs onduleuses chevelures.
Serait-il possible d'oublier tout cela? Oui, un schisme
Entretenu par la frivolité et la barbarie
Fut cause que le grand Apollon rougit pour son pays.
Ceux-là étaient considérés comme sages qui étaient incapables de comprendre
Ses gloires; avec la faiblesse d'un enfant piailleur
Ils se balancèrent sur un cheval à bascule
Croyant enfourcher Pégase. O âmes impitoyables!
Les vents du ciel soufflaient, l'Océan roulait
Ses vagues rassemblées en un élan—vous ne l'avez pas senti. L'azur
Découvrait son sein éternel, et la rosée
Des nuits d'été se condensait toujours pour rendre
Le matin précieux: c'était l'éveil de la beauté!
Pourquoi, vous, n'étiez-vous pas éveillées? Mais vous étiez mortes
Aux choses que vous ne connaissiez pas,—vous étiez étroitement
Liées à des lois surannées que nous imposaient de pitoyables règles
Et de mesquines limitations: de sorte que vous appreniez à une troupe
[Pg 194]De butors à polir, à marqueter, à rogner, à ajuster,
Jusqu'à ce que, semblables à certaines baguettes de l'esprit de Jacob,
Leurs vers se fussent taillés. Aisée était la tâche:
Un millier d'artisans portaient le masque
De poètes. Race déshéritée! Race impie!
Qui blasphémait le brillant lyrique
Et qui ne s'en apercevait pas,—non, ils marchaient
Brandissant un misérable étendard décrépit
Sur lequel étaient inscrites les plus falotes devises et en grands caractères
Le nom d'un certain Boileau!

O vous dont l'office
Est de planer au-dessus de nos plaisantes collines!
Dont la majestueuse réunion comble tellement
Mon humble[1] vénération que je n'ose inscrire
Vos noms consacrés à cette place profane,
Si près de cette vile populace: leurs hontes
Ne vous ont-elles pas épouvantés? Les lamentations de notre vieille Tamise
Vous ont-elles enchantés? Ne vous êtes-vous jamais groupés
Sur les bords du délicieux Avon, en répandant de lugubres
Larmes? Ou avez-vous complètement dit adieu
Aux contrées où plus jamais n'a crû le laurier?
Ou demeuriez-vous pour souhaiter la bienvenue
[Pg 195]A quelques esprits solitaires qui pouvaient fièrement chanter
La perte de leur jeunesse et mourir? C'était précisément ainsi
Mais éloignons de notre pensée ces époques malheureuses:
Maintenant nous voilà dans une saison plus favorable; vous avez soufflé
De riches bénédictions sur nos têtes; vous avez tressé
De fraîches guirlandes; car de douces mélodies furent entendues
En maints endroits;—quelques-unes ont été tirées
De leur demeure cristalline au fond d'un lac,
Par le bec d'ébène d'un cygne; d'un épais fourré
Nichées et tranquilles en une paisible vallée
D'autres s'égrènent en notes de pipeaux; de belles harmonies flottent en désordre
Sur la terre: heureux vous êtes et contents.

Comment douter de tout cela? oui, c'est certain,
La puissance du chant nous a dotés d'étranges tonnerres,
Des tonnerres mélangés avec ce qui est doux et fort,
Issus de la majesté. Mais, pour être juste, les thèmes
Sont d'informes monstres, les Poètes eux-mêmes sont des Polyphèmes
Qui perturbent le grand Océan. C'est une ondée inépuisable
De lumière que la poésie; c'est le pouvoir suprême;
[Pg 196]C'est une puissance sommeillant à demi, sur son propre bras droit.
Le plissement de ses sourcils arqués suffit pour forcer
A obéir des milliers de serviteurs empressés,
Et toujours elle commande avec le froncement le plus indulgent.
Mais la force seule, quoique née des Muses,
Est comme un ange déchu: arbres arrachés,
Obscurité, larves, suaires et sépulcres
Font ses délices; elle est alimentée par les bardanes
Et les ronces de la vie; oubliant le véritable but
De la poésie: qu'elle doit être une amie
Qui allège les soucis et élève les pensées de l'homme.

Oui, je me réjouis: un myrthe comme il n'en est
Jamais poussé à Paphos, au milieu des broussailles amères
Dresse dans l'air sa douce tête, et emplit
Un espace silencieux d'une verdure sans cesse bourgeonnante.
Les oiseaux les plus amoureux y trouvent un plaisant abri,
Se glissent sous son ombrage avec de gracieux battements d'ailes,
Picotent les calices des fleurettes et chantent.
Dégageons-le donc des ronces qui l'étouffent
En enserrant son noble tronc; que les jeunes faons
Mis bas plus tard, quand nous sommes partis,
Trouvent en dessous un gazon frais, recouvert
De simples fleurs; que là ne soit rien
De plus violent que le genou fléchi d'un amant;
[Pg 197]Rien de plus cruel que le regard placide
D'un lecteur penché sur un livre fermé,
Rien de plus agité que les pentes herbeuses
Entre deux collines. Salut au délicieux espoir!
Comme elle en avait l'habitude, l'imagination
Se sera égarée dans les plus charmants labyrinthes,
Et ils seront proclamés poètes rois
Ceux qui simplement disent les choses les plus touchantes pour le cœur.
O que ces joies soient mûres avant que je meure!

Ne dira-t-on pas que j'ai présomptueusement
Parlé? que devant une disgrâce précipitée
Il eut été bien préférable de voiler ma face insensée?
Qu'une enfance geignarde devrait s'incliner respectueusement
Plutôt que la redoutable foudre ne l'atteigne? Comment!
Si je me cache, ce sera sûrement
Dans le temple même, la lumière de la Poésie:
Si je succombe, au moins je serai porté
Sous l'ombre silencieuse d'un peuplier
Et sur moi l'herbe tendre sera tondue;
Et là on sculptera une image aimable de moi.
Cependant, arrière! Découragement! misérable fléau!
Ils ne devraient pas te connaître ceux qui dans leur soif d'atteindre
Un noble but, ont soif à chaque heure.
Quoique je ne sois pas riche des dons
D'une sagesse bien ample; quoique je ne connaisse pas
[Pg 198]Les artifices des vents puissante qui soufflent
Çà et là toutes les pensées changeantes
Des mortels; quoique aucune grande raison directrice n'éclaire
Les noirs mystères des âmes humaines
D'une conception nette: pourtant toujours se dévoile
Une vaste idée devant moi, et j'en déduis
Ma liberté; c'est de là aussi que j'ai aperçu
La fin et le but de la Poésie. C'est évident
Comme la chose la plus vraie, comme l'année
Est composée de quatre saisons—manifeste
Comme une large croix, comme le clocher de quelque vieille cathédrale,
Qui s'élève vers la blancheur des nuages. Dussé-je donc
N'être que la quintessence de la laideur,
Un lâche, dûssent mes yeux se fermer
Lorsque j'exprime bien haut ce que j'ai osé penser!
Ah! que plutôt je sois un fou se précipitant
Dans quelque gouffre! que le brûlant soleil
Fonde mes ailes de Dédale et me fasse tomber
Convulsé et la tête la première! Arrête! un intime remords
De conscience m'ordonne plus de calme pendant un instant.
Un océan obscur, parsemé de nombreuses îles,
S'étend majestueux devant moi. Combien de labeur!
Combien de jours! Quel tumulte désespéré!
Avant que j'aie pu explorer son immensité.
Ah! quelle tâche! les genoux infléchis
[Pg 199]Je pourrais renier mes paroles—non, impossible!
Impossible!

Pour prendre un doux repos, je demeurerai
Sur de plus humbles pensées et laisserai cet étrange essai
Qui a débuté dans la grâce se terminer de même.
Aussi bien, maintenant toute inquiétude s'évanouit dans mon cœur:
Je me tourne plein de reconnaissance vers les aides amicales
Qui m'aplanissent le sentier de l'honneur: fraternité
Et amitié, qu'entretient une bienveillance réciproque.
La cordiale étreinte qui inspire un aimable sonnet
A votre cerveau avant qu'on ait eu le temps d'y songer;
Le silence lorsque quelques rimes vous viennent;
Et quand elles sont venues, qu'elles se ruent en joyeuse cohue:
Voilà le message assuré pour le lendemain.
Peut-être est-ce aussi bien que si on tirait
Quelque précieux livre de sa confortable retraite
Pour se grouper autour la prochaine fois que nous nous rencontrerons.
A peine puis-je écrire d'une façon continue; de délicieuses mélodies
Voltigent à travers la chambre comme des couples de colombes;
Beaucoup de joies rappellent cet heureux jour
Où pour la première fois mes sens ont saisi leur tendre chute.
[Pg 200]Et avec ces mélodies apparurent des formes d'élégance,
Epaules inclinées sur un cheval fringant,
Insouciantes, élancées—doigts délicats et potelés
Partageant de luxuriantes boucles; et le prompt élan
De Bacchus hors de son char, lorsque ses yeux
Firent rougir les joues d'Ariadne.
C'est ainsi que je me rappelle tout le plaisant enivrement
Des mots en ouvrant un portefeuille.

Des signes semblables sont toujours précurseurs
D'une suite d'images pacifiques: les mouvements
D'un cou de cygne entrevu parmi les joncs;
Une linotte tressaillant au milieu des buissons;
Un papillon, les ailes dorées grandes ouvertes,
Niché sur une rose, convulsé comme s'il souffrait
D'un excès de plaisir beaucoup, beaucoup plus,
Pourrais-je me complaire à étaler tout mon stock
De jouissances: mais je ne dois pas oublier
Le sommeil, calme avec sa couronne de pavots:
Car ce qu'il peut y avoir de valeur dans ces rimes
Je le lui dois en partie; ainsi les accents
Des voix amicales avaient juste cédé la place
A un si doux silence, lorsque je commençai à décrire
Le charme de la journée, à l'aise sur un divan.
C'était la demeure d'un poète qui conserve la clé
Du temple du plaisir. Tout autour étaient appendus
Les glorieux traits des bardes qui chantèrent
Dans les autres âges—bustes austères et sacrés
Se souriant l'un à l'autre. Heureux qui confie
[Pg 201]A un Avenir serein sa renommée chérie!
Alors il y avait des faunes et des satyres s'efforçant
D'atteindre des pommes gonflées, avec des bonds joyeux
Et des doigts avides, parmi les touffes succulentes
Des feuilles de vigne. Là s'élevait à la vue un temple
De marbre veiné, vers lequel une troupe
De nymphes s'avançait noblement sur le gazon:
L'une, la plus séduisante, étend sa main droite
Vers l'éblouissant lever du soleil; deux sœurs adorables
Inclinent leurs gracieuses figures jusqu'à se rencontrer
Au-dessus des gambades d'un petit enfant;
D'autres écartent curieusement l'agreste
Et pénétrante liquidité du chalumeau trempé de buée.
Regardez! voici un autre tableau: des Nymphes essuient
Avec soin les membres rosés de Diane;
La bordure d'un pré pareil à un manteau de verdure s'avance dans l'eau
Et s'y baigne; elle suit mollement le mouvement
De l'onde cristalline qui la supporte. De même l'océan
Soulève en un lent gonflement sa large surface par dessus
Les grèves rocheuses, et balance chaque fois
Les dociles broussailles, qui sans être détruites par l'écume
Ressentent toute la puissance des vagues, leur demeure.
La pensive tête de Sapho était là souriante à demi
Sans cause; comme si justement le sérieux froncement
Causé par la réflexion avait en ce moment quitté
Son front et l'avait laissée seule.
[Pg 202]Alfred-le-Grand aussi, les yeux inquiets, pleins de pitié,
Comme s'il écoutait éternellement les soupirs
Du monde affolé; et Kociusko torturé
D'horribles souffrances—terriblement désolé.

Pétrarque, émergeant de l'ombre verdoyante
Tressaille à la vue de Laure sans pouvoir détacher
Ses yeux du visage aimé. Heureux sont-ils!
Car au-dessus d'eux on distinguait un libre déploiement
D'ailes étendues entre lesquelles brillait
La figure de la Poésie: du haut de son trône
Elle regardait des choses que je pourrais à peine citer.
Le véritable sens de l'état dans lequel je me trouvais pourrait bien
Tenir le Sommeil éloigné; mais en plus vinrent alors
Pensées sur pensées qui nourrirent la flamme
Dans mon sein, de sorte que la lumière matinale
Me surprit justement après une nuit d'insomnie;
Et je me levai réconforté, satisfait, gai,
Résolu de commencer ce jour même
Ces lignes; et de quelque façon qu'elles soient venues,
Je les laisse comme fait un père pour son fils.

ENDYMION[1]
Dédié à la mémoire de Thomas Chatterton.



LIVRE PREMIER
—Une chose de beauté est une joie éternelle;
Son charme s'accroît; jamais elle ne
Rentrera dans le néant; toujours au contraire elle nous assurera
Une retraite paisible, un sommeil
Plein de doux rêves, la santé, une respiration égale.
Aussi, chaque matin, tressons-nous
Une guirlande de fleurs qui nous enchaîne sur la terre,
[Pg 204]En dépit du découragement, de l'inhumaine disette
De nobles créatures, des jours tristes,
De toutes les routes pestilentielles et enténébrées
S'ouvrant à nos recherches: oui, en dépit de tout,
Une forme quelconque de beauté rejette le crêpe
Loin de nos esprits assombris. Tels le soleil, la lune,
Les arbres vieux et jeunes, qui prodiguent leur ombre bienfaisante
Pour une simple brebis; tels les narcisses
Dans leur séjour verdoyant; et les clairs ruisseaux
Que défendent les buissons rafraîchissants
Contre la saison chaude; la fougère au cœur de la forêt,
Richement tachetée comme de belles roses mousses:
Telle aussi la grandeur des jugements
Que nous avons portés sur nos morts illustres;
Tous les contes délicieux que nous avons lus ou entendus:
Fontaine inépuisable nous dispensant un immortel
Breuvage dont la source est au ciel.

Et nous n'éprouvons pas simplement ces sensations
Pour une heure rapide; non, de même que les arbres
Bruissant autour d'un temple deviennent bientôt
Aussi vénérés que le temple lui-même, de même fait la lune,
La passion pour la poésie, gloires infinies, qui
Nous hantent jusqu'à ce qu'elles deviennent une lueur consolatrice
[Pg 205]S'insinuant dans nos âmes, et se liant si intimement à nous,
Que, brillantes ou sombres,
Toujours elles devront demeurer en nous, sinon nous mourrons.

—C'est donc avec une allégresse infinie que je
Retracerai l'histoire d'Endymion.
La musique même du nom a pénétré
Dans mon être, et chaque riante scène
Surgit devant moi aussi fraîche que la verdure
De nos propres vallées: aussi vais-je commencer
Maintenant que je n'entends pas le vacarme de la ville,
Maintenant que les premiers bourgeons viennent d'éclore,
Et se répandent en couleurs de la nuance la plus tendre
A travers la vieille forêt; pendant que le saule traîne
Jusqu'à terre ses fines branches; et que la laitière
Rentre chez elle, le seau plein de lait. Et, tandis que l'année
Gonfle les tiges d'un suc abondant, je gouvernerai doucement
Mon petit esquif, pendant maintes heures calmes,
Au fil de l'eau coulant dans la profondeur des frais bocages.
Plus d'un vers j'espère écrire,
Avant que les blanches pâquerettes cerclées de vermillon,
[Pg 206]Soient cachées sous l'épaisseur de l'herbe. Avant aussi que les abeilles
Bourdonnent autour des trèfles globulaires et des pois de senteur,
Je devrai avoir conté la moitié de mon récit.
Oh! puisse aucune saison d'hiver, chenue et dépouillée.
Ne la trouver à demi-terminée: mais que le fier Automne
Qui teinte d'or mat la nature entière
Soit l'époque où j'écrirai la fin.
Et maintenant, d'un cœur aventureux, je fais voler
Ma pensée en héraut à travers le désert:
Que les trompettes sonnent, qu'aussitôt
Ma route incertaine se pare de verdure, pour que je puisse rapidement
Avancer sans encombre, foulant fleurs et ronces!

Sur les flancs du Latmos s'étendait
Une puissante forêt, tant la terre humide nourrissait
Plantureusement les racines cachées et les transformait
En branches retombantes et en fruits précieux.
Là se trouvaient d'épais ombrages sequestrés dans les profondeurs
Où jamais l'homme ne pénétrait; et si hors de la garde du berger
Un agneau s'égarait au loin dans les bas-fonds de ces gorges retirées,
Jamais plus il ne revoyait les parcs hospitaliers
Dans lesquels ses frères, bêlant de contentement,
[Pg 207]Sur le sommet des collines rentraient à chaque tombée de la nuit.
Parmi les bergers c'était une croyance
Qu'aucun agneau laineux qui se séparait ainsi
De sa blanche famille, ne passait sans être épargné
Par le loup affamé ou le léopard au regard scrutateur
Avant d'atteindre quelque plaine inviolée,
Où se nourrissaient les troupeaux de Pan: toujours grands étaient les gains
De celui qui perdait un agneau ainsi. De nombreux sentiers
Serpentaient à travers les glorieuses fougères et les joncs des marais
Et les bancs de lierre; tous conduisaient agréablement
A une vaste clairière d'où on pouvait voir
Des troncs se pressant alentour entre les ondulations
Du gazon et les branches inclinées: qui pourrait dépeindre
La fraîcheur de la voûte céleste en cet endroit,
Sur laquelle se découpaient les cimes sombres des arbres? Une colombe
Se serait plu à la sillonner fréquemment de ses ailes, et souvent aussi
Un nuage léger en aurait traversé le bleu.

Au centre même de ce site radieux
S'érigeait un autel de marbre, orné d'un feston
De fleurs nouvellement écloses; et la rosée
Avec une féérique fantaisie avait jonché
[Pg 208]De marguerites, la veille au soir, la pelouse sacrée
Ainsi parée pour recevoir solennellement la lumière de l'aube.
Car c'était le matin: du haut du ciel le feu d'Apollon
Transformait chaque nuage de l'Orient en bûcher argenté
D'un éclat si transparent que, là,
Une âme mélancolique aurait pu gagner
L'oubli, et dissoudre sa fine essence
Dans le vent; la senteur humide de l'églantine
Tempérait l'ardeur de ce soleil si caressant;
L'alouette était perdue en lui; les froides sources couraient
Chauffer sur le gazon leurs bouillonnements glacés;
Des voix d'hommes vibraient sur les montagnes; enfin
Décuplées étaient les pulsations de la masse vivante de la nature et de ses merveilles
A sentir ce lever de soleil et ses gloires antiques.
[Arrive le cortège des bergers qui célèbrent la fête de Pan.]

En avant dansaient de jeunes vierges montrant le chemin,
Répétant les refrains des chansons pastorales;
Chacune avait au front une couronne de rameaux
De la couleur tendre d'Avril: tout près, en ordre,
Une troupe de bergers, la figure brunie
Tels qu'on les voit dans les récits d'Arcadie;
[Pg 209]Ou tels ceux qui s'asseyaient autour du pipeau d'Apollon
Lorsque ce grand Dieu, sur la terre chargée de moissons,
Oubliant sa divinité, épanchait son âme
En musique, à travers les vallées Thessaliennes:
Les uns traînaient indolemment leurs houlettes sur le gazon,
Et d'autres tiraient des sons perçants ou veloutés
De leurs flûtes d'ébène: immédiatement après eux
Sortant des profondeurs de la forêt,
Un vénérable prêtre suffisamment replet
Attirait les regards par sa solennité: ses yeux sans cesse
Demeuraient attachés sur l'herbe du sol,
Que derrière lui courbait la traîne de sa robe sacrée.
Dans sa main droite se balançait un vase, d'un ton laiteux,
Rempli de vin mélangé, lançant de généreuses lueurs:
Et de sa gauche il tenait un panier plein
De toutes les herbes parfumées que le regard peut découvrir:
Le thym sauvage, le muguet plus blanc encore
Que l'amant de Léda, et le cresson du ruisseau.
Sa tête blanchie, ornée d'une guirlande de hêtre,
Semblait un dôme de lierre enserré
Par le froid hivernal. Puis venait une autre troupe
De bergers qui faisaient retentir alternativement
Les couplets de la chanson. Après eux apparut,
Suivi par la foule qui élevait
[Pg 210]Sa voix jusqu'aux nuages, un char finement sculpté
Et roulant si mollement qu'à peine entravait-il
La liberté de trois coursiers tachetés de brun:
Celui qui les conduit semble jouir d'un grand renom
Parmi la multitude. Sa jeunesse est en plein épanouissement,
Tel Ganymède ayant atteint l'âge viril;
Et pour ces temps primitifs, son costume était
Celui d'un chef: sur sa poitrine, à demi-nue,
Etait pendu un cor d'argent, et entre
Ses genoux nerveux il maintenait un épieu acéré.
Un sourire animait son visage; il semblait,
Pour le commun des mortels, rêver
Du repos divin dans les champs Elyséens:
Mais de plus avisés pouvaient discerner
Un trouble secret au frémissement de sa lèvre inférieure,
Et remarquer que parfois les rênes glissaient
De ses mains oublieuses; alors ils auraient soupiré
En songeant aux feuilles jaunies, au cri du hibou
Et aux bûches entassées pour le sacrifice. Hélas!
O notre Endymion, pourquoi ta jeunesse dépérit-elle?

Bientôt l'assemblée, en cercle rangée,
Demeurait silencieuse autour de l'autel: le regard de chacun
Exprima soudain la vénération: les tendres mères
Firent taire leurs enfants; tandis que les joues
Rosées des vierges pâlirent légèrement de peur.
Endymion aussi, sans égal dans la forêt,
[Pg 211]Se tenait debout, blême, hâve, la figure empreinte de respect,
Au milieu de ses compagnons, les chasseurs de la montagne.
Au centre, le vénérable prêtre
Leur souriait à tous du plus grand au plus petit,
Et après avoir levé au ciel ses mains ridées
Il parla ainsi: «Hommes de Latmos! pasteurs
Auxquels échoit la garde de milliers de moutons:
Que vous descendiez des antres des rochers
Qui dominent vos montagnes; que vous veniez
Des vallées où le chalumeau retentit sans fin,
Ou des plaines luxuriantes, où la fraîcheur de la brise caresse
Délicatement la campanule bleue, où les genêts épineux
Prodiguent leurs boutons d'or; qui veillez vos précieux troupeaux
Paissant jusqu'à satiété sur les bords mêmes de la mer
Là où les roseaux harmonieux frissonnent aux tristes mélodies
Qu'en échos affaiblis chante la conque du vieux Triton.
Mères et épouses! qui chaque jour préparez
La besace et ce qu'il faut pour la montagne;
Et vous toutes, gentilles vierges qui nourrissez de lait
Les agneaux sans mère, et dans une mignonne coupe
Conservez le miel choisi pour votre jeune fiancé:
Oui, que chacun m'écoute! N'est-il pas vrai
Que tous nos vœux sont dus à notre grand Dieu Pan?
[Pg 212]Nos génisses mugissantes ne reluisent-elles pas plus que
Les champignons gonflés par la nuit? Nos vastes prairies
Ne sont-elles pas tachetées d'innombrables toisons? La pluie
Ne verdit-elle pas le gazon d'Avril? Aucun hurlement farouche
N'épouvante nos timides brebis; et nous avons toujours joui
De la grande faveur d'Endymion, notre maître.
La terre est heureuse et la joyeuse alouette lance
Sa chanson matinale à travers la fraîcheur du soleil,
Dont l'éclat rayonne sur nos pieuses cérémonies.»

Il dit, et sur l'autel il fit jaillir en spirale
Les doux parfums qui s'enflamment au feu sacré.
Bientôt il arrosa l'herbe grasse et assoiffée
Avec du vin en l'honneur du divin berger.
Et pendant que le sol buvait, pendant
Que les feuilles de laurier pétillaient, monceau odoriférant,
Que l'encens scintillait à travers
Le persil en cendres, et qu'une flamme brumeuse
Teintait l'Orient de fumée, alors un chœur chanta:

«O toi, dont le palais grandiose a pour toit
Des branches rongées par les ans, et de son ombre abrite
Les éternels murmures, les tristesses, naissance, vie et mort
De fleurs inconnues, et leur procure une paix immuable;
Toi qui te plais à voir les hamadryades réparer
[Pg 213]Le désordre de leurs tresses dans les taillis épais des coudriers;
Toi qui t'assieds pendant des heures solennelles, pour écouter
La plaintive mélodie des roseaux courbés par le vent—
Dans les sites désolés, où une chaude moiteur donne
Aux sapins siffleurs une étrange croissance;
Tu songes alors quelle mélancolie pesa sur toi
Lorsque tu perdis la belle Syrinx—entends-nous aujourd'hui,
Par le front de ta nymphe au teint de lait!
Par tous les dédales de sa fuite éperdue,
Entends-nous, ô divin Pan!

«O toi! Dieu de la douce quiétude, pour qui les tourterelles
Soupirent leurs duos passionnés parmi les myrtes,
Tandis qu'à la tombée du jour tu erres
Par les prés ensoleillés qui bordent la lisière
De ton domaine moussu: O toi, à qui
Les figuiers aux larges feuilles ont dès maintenant prédestiné
Leur récolte mûrissante; les abeilles ceinturées d'or
Leur miel blond; les prés de nos campagnes
Les plus somptueuses fleurs de fèves et les coquelicots des blés;
C'est pour toi que la linotte élève sa couvée
Et lui enseigne le chant; que les fraises aux tiges rampantes
[Pg 214]Gardent l'été leur fraîcheur; l'essaim des papillons
Ses ailes tachetées; que les tendres bourgeons du printemps
S'épanouissent.—Parais à notre prière!
Par la brise qui, sur les monts, incline les sapins,
O divin forestier!

«Vers toi, les faunes et les Satyres accourent
Pour te servir; soit qu'ils surprennent
En leurs gîtes les lièvres à moitié assoupis;
Soit qu'ils franchissent des précipices escarpés
Pour arracher les malheureux agneaux à la serre des aigles;
Ou que par un charme mystérieux ils fassent retrouver
Aux bergers égarés le chemin du logis;
Qu'ils s'ébattent à perdre haleine sur les rivages écumants
Et choisissent les coquillages aux formes bizarres
Pour que tu puisses les lancer dans les ondes des Naïades,
Puis, de ta cachette, t'en moquer lorsqu'elles montrent la tête;
Soit qu'ils t'égayent de leurs cabrioles fantasques
Pendant qu'ils se jettent réciproquement à la tête
Les glands argentés, et les pommes de pins roussâtres—
Par tous les échos qui vibrent autour de toi,
Entends-nous, ô Faune Roi!

«O toi, qui écoutes le bruit clair des ciseaux,
Tandis que, par intervalles vers ses compagnons tondus
[Pg 215]Un bélier retourne en bêlant: Toi qui sonnes du cor
Lorsque les sangliers au farouche boutoir ravageant les tendres épis
Enflamment le courroux du chasseur: qui de ton souffle protèges nos fermes,
Pour en écarter les nielles, et tous les fléaux des tempêtes:
Etrange auteur de bruits indéfinissables
Qui se répercutent par monts et vaux, s'affaiblissent graduellement
Et devenus soupirs meurent sur les landes stériles:
Redoutable gardien des portes mystérieuses
Qui s'ouvrent sur l'universel savoir—regarde,
Fils puissant de Dryope,
La foule de ceux qui viennent t'offrir leurs vœux
Le front couronné de feuillages!

«Oh! sois toujours la retraite inaccessible
Des pensées solitaires; telle par maints détours vous mènerait
Une idée jusqu'au seuil du paradis,
Et vous laisserait le cerveau désespéré: sois toujours le levain
Qui fermente en ce monde bestial et grossier
L'élève jusqu'au ciel—lui donne une vie nouvelle:
Sois toujours un symbole d'immensité:
Un firmament reflété sur l'infini des eaux;
Un élément qui comble l'espace entre eux;
[Pg 216]Un inconnu—mais silence: humblement nous masquons
Nos fronts de nos mains soulevées, nous courbant jusqu'à terre,
Nous poussons des clameurs pour que l'Olympe entende,
Et te conjurons d'exaucer notre hymne implorateur
Du haut du Mont Lycée!»
[Cependant Endymion, le roi des bergers, est atteint d'une incurable mélancolie. Péona, sa sœur, lui arrache son secret et lui reproche un chimérique amour.]

Est-ce là la cause?
Tout entière? Cependant n'est-il pas étrange, et triste hélas!
Qu'un être, qui devrait passer sur cette terre
Comme un demi-dieu dans son royaume, et laisser
Son nom résonnant sur les cordes de la lyre, finisse
Sans avoir été jamais plus qu'un barde en sa virginité,
Chantant seul, et timidement:—comment le sang
Abandonna ses pommettes juvéniles, comment il avait coutume de s'égarer
Il ne savait pas où; et comment il répondrait, «non,»
Si on lui affirmait que c'était l'amour: et cependant, c'était l'amour;
Que pouvait-ce être si ce n'est l'amour? Comment une palombe
Laissa tomber une aiguille d'if sur son chemin;
[Pg 217]Et comment il mourut; puis, que l'amour ravage
Son gentil cœur, de même que les ouragans du Nord flétrissent les roses.
Enfin que la ballade de sa triste vie se termine
Par des soupirs, et un hélas! Endymion!
[Celui-ci prend la défense de l'amour.]

«Peona! je n'ai jamais désiré étancher
Ma soif pour les louanges du monde: rien de méprisable,
Aucun fantôme endormeur, ne pourrait défiler
Le tissu que j'ai obstinément ouvragé pour mon voyage—
Pourtant il est maintenant en morceaux; ma barque sans gouvernail
Va tristement à la dérive: cependant mes espérances sublimes
Visent un but trop élevé, trop au delà de l'arc-en-ciel
Pour qu'elles puissent s'user sur cette myriade d'épaves terrestres.
Où est le bonheur? En ce qui pousse
Nos esprits dociles vers une union divine,
Une union avec l'essence; jusqu'à ce que nous resplendissions
Absolument transfigurés et libérés de l'espace. Contemple
La claire religion du ciel! Enveloppe
D'une feuille de rose ton doigt effilé,
Et caresse tes lèvres: écoute, lorsque les accents aériens
[Pg 218]Et les baisers de la musique font résonner les libres vents,
Lorsqu'avec une touche amoureuse ils détachent
La harpe Eolienne de son écaille transparente:
Alors de vieilles chansons s'éveillent hors des sépulcres entr'ouverts;
De vieilles ballades soupirent au-dessus de la tombe de l'aïeul;
Des fantômes de mélodieuses prophéties délirent
Autour de chaque empreinte qu'a laissée le pied d'Apollon;
La fanfare des clairons s'éveille, puis mollement s'éteint,
Là où longtemps auparavant s'était livrée une bataille géante;
Et, de la terre, s'exhale une berceuse
A chaque place où le jeune Orphée dormait.
Ressentons-nous ces choses?—en ce moment nous sommes entrés
Dans une sorte d'unité, et notre état
Est celui d'esprits qui flottent. Mais il y a
Des enchevêtrements plus compliqués, des entraves
S'entredétruisant bien davantage, et conduisant, par degrés
A la plus extrême intensité: leur couronne
Est tressée d'amour et d'amitié, et siège haut
Sur le front de l'humanité.
Sa valeur la plus pesante et la plus volumineuse
Est l'amitié d'où émane sans cesse
Une splendeur persistante; mais au sommet,
Est suspendue, par d'invisibles fils, une sphère
[Pg 219]De lumière, c'est l'amour: son influence,
Frappant nos yeux, engendre un sens nouveau,
Qui nous agite et nous use; jusqu'à ce qu'enfin
Nous dissolvant dans son rayonnement, nous nous confondions,
Nous mêlions, nous en devenions une partie—
Avec rien d'autre notre âme ne peut se lier
Aussi rapidement: quand nous nous combinons de la sorte,
La vie s'alimente de sa propre substance,
Et nous sommes nourris comme la couvée du pélican.
Ah! si délicieuse est cette nourriture qui ne rassasie pas,
Que les hommes, qui auraient pu planer dans le van
De tout l'univers assemblé, pour vanner
Et chasser loin des pas du futur
Toutes les ivraies de la coutume, balayer toutes les viscosités
Laissées par les limaces et les serpents de l'humanité,
Ont été satisfaits de perdre l'occasion
Tandis qu'ils sommeillaient dans l'Elysée de l'amour,
En vérité, je préférerais être frappé de mutisme
Plutôt que d'élever la voix contre leur ardente insouciance:
Car j'ai toujours pensé qu'elle pouvait gratifier
Le monde de bienfaits inconsciemment;
Comme fait le rossignol, perché sur la plus haute branche,
Et cloîtré au milieu des touffes de feuilles fraîches—
Il ne chante qu'à son amour, et ne s'aperçoit même pas
[Pg 220]Que la Nuit s'avançant sur la pointe du pied retient les plis de son capuchon noir.
De même l'amour pourrait, bien qu'on le juge
Un simple mélange d'haleines passionnées,
Produire plus que notre recherche ne témoigne:
Quoi, je l'ignore: mais qui, parmi les hommes peut dire
Que les fleurs s'épanouiraient, ou que les fruits verts se gonfleraient
Jusqu'à devenir pulpe fondante, que les poissons auraient leurs brillantes écailles,
La terre son douaire de rivières, de forêts, de vallées,
Les prairies leurs ruisseaux, les ruisseaux leurs cailloux,
Les semences leurs moissons, ou le luth ses accents,
Les accents leur ravissement, ou le ravissement son charme,
Si les âmes humaines ne s'embrassaient et ne se saluaient jamais?

Maintenant, si cet amour terrestre a le pouvoir de rendre
L'être humain mortel, immortel; de rejeter
L'ambition hors de leurs mémoires, et de combler
Leur mesure de bonheur; quelle pure folie
Semblent tous ces piteux efforts vers la renommée,
A qui se réserve comme unique but
Un amour immortel, une immortelle amante!
Ne sois pas si effaré; car c'est la vérité,
Jamais ne pourra naître d'atomes
Ce qui bourdonne autour de nos rêves, comme des mouches du cerveau,
[Pg 221]Nous laissant l'imagination malade. Non, non, j'en suis certain,
Mon esprit inquiet ne supporterait jamais
De couver si longtemps une volupté,
S'il n'épiait, quoique craintivement
Une espérance derrière l'ombre d'un rêve.»
LIVRE II
[Au début de ce deuxième livre le poète célèbre la toute puissance et l'amour. Qu'est tout le reste en comparaison?]

Hors d'ici, histoire pompeuse! hors, fourberie dorée!
Sombre planète dans l'univers des faits!
Vaste mer, qui élève un murmure sans fin
Sur les rivages caillouteux de la mémoire!
Bien des vieux bateaux à la carcasse vermoulue là
Voguent sur ton sein, magnifiés
En vaisseaux de haut bord; plus d'un navire orgueilleux
A la carène dorée, est abandonné dans la cale sans avoir été lancé.
Mais pourquoi ceci? Peu nous chaut que le hibou ait volé
Autour du mât du grand amiral Athénien!
Peu nous chaut qu'à marches forcées Alexandre ait dépassé
[Pg 222]L'Indus avec ses troupes Macédoniennes!
Qu'Ulysse ait réveillé en le torturant
Le Cyclope gorgé, peu nous importe! Juliette penchée
Par-dessus les fleurs de sa croisée—soupirant—sevrant
Tendrement son amour de sa neigeuse pureté,
Nous intéresse davantage: le ruisseau argenté
Des larmes d'Héros, la défaillance d'Imogène,
La belle Pastorella dans la caverne du bandit,
Sont des sujets qu'on couve avec plus d'ardeur
Que la chute des empires..........
[Puis Endymion entreprend de retrouver sa mystérieuse beauté]

Alors, de nouveau,
Il s'enfonça dans un sentier désert
Où jamais aucun son humain n'avait retenti,
Si ce n'est, peut être, quelques cadences légères comme la neige
Se dissolvant dans le silence, lorsque sous la brise
Quelque barque sacrée entonnait une hymne harmonieuse,
En voguant joyeusement vers Delphes.
[Une nymphe, déguisée en papillon, lui sert de guide. Ils explorent le monde souterrain et rencontrent d'abord Vénus et Adonis.]

Après avoir parcouru mille détours,
Enfin, avançant soudain, il pénétra dans
Une pièce, tapissée de myrtes, formant un berceau très élevé,
[Pg 223]Remplie de lumière, d'encens, d'harmonieux accords,
Et de ce qu'il y avait à la fois d'admirable et d'étrange:
Car sur une couche de satin d'une splendeur rosée
Au centre, reposait un éphèbe endormi
De la plus enivrante beauté; plus enivrante en vérité
Que les désirs ne pouvaient la sonder ou la jouissance l'atteindre:
Puis des tentures aux tons dorés de la pêche
Ou des soucis fanés par la maturité d'Octobre,
Tombaient rutilantes à ses côtés avec mille replis—
Sans rien cacher de la courbe Apollonienne
De la nuque et de l'épaule, ni de l'écartement
D'un genou à l'autre, ni des chevilles accrochant la lumière;
Mais plutôt, livrant sans voile ses charmes au regard,
Généreusement. De profil son visage était appuyé
Sur un bras blanc, et tendrement demi-closes
Par la plus tendre pression, les lèvres vermeilles
Dessinaient une moue alanguie causée par le sommeil; de même la chaude matinée
Fait s'entr'ouvrir la rose aux pétales humides. Au-dessus de sa tête
Quatre tiges de lys mariaient leurs blancs honneurs
Pour former une couronne; autour de lui croissaient
Toutes les vrilles vertes, de floraisons et de nuances infinies,
Entrelacées les unes aux autres et fraîchement liées:
La vigne aux pousses luisantes; les mailles du lierre
[Pg 224]Ombrageant ses baies Ethiopiennes; le chèvre-feuille des bois
Aux feuilles veloutées, aux divines fleurs en forme de cors;
Le convolvulus aux corolles ardemment panachées;
Le creeper, mûrissant pour rougir en automne;
La clématite des haies, grimpant allègrement,
Avec d'autres plantes ses sœurs. Tout près
Veillaient des Amours paisibles et silencieux.
L'un, agenouillé à côté d'une lyre, en touchait les cordes,
Dont il assourdissait les sons avec ses ailes;
Et, de temps en temps il se levait pour observer
Le sommeil de l'éphèbe; pendant qu'un autre saisissait
Une branche de saule, qui distillait une rosée odorante,
Et la secouait sur sa chevelure; un autre pénétrait
Par la toiture tissée, et à chaque battement d'aile
Faisait pleuvoir des violettes sur ses yeux assoupis.

Tout à coup sous une arche rugueuse, à travers la pénombre au-dessous d'eux
Apparaît la mère des dieux, Cybèle, seule, toute seule,
Sur un sombre char; un manteau noir drapant
Sa majestueuse stature, le front pâle comme la mort,
Couronné de tourelles. Quatre lions à l'épaisse crinière
Traînent les indolentes roues; solennelles sont leurs mâchoires ventrues,
Leurs yeux menacent dissimulés sous les sourcils, leurs lourdes pattes
[Pg 225]S'étirent comme dans le sommeil, et leurs queues nerveusement
Font trembler leurs poils hérissés. Silencieuse passe
La reine, comme une ombre, et elle disparaît dans l'obscurité d'une autre arche.
[Après avoir enfin entrevu son amante inconnue, Endymion visita la région des fleuves souterrains où il aperçut Alphée et Aréthuse, ensuite.]

Il se retourna—là retentit un son puissant—il marcha,
Apparût là une lumière plus froide; alors il se dirigea
Vers elle par un sentier sablonneux, et Io!
Voici qu'en moins de temps qu'un instant ne fuit,
Les visions de la terre furent dissoutes et envolées—
Il aperçut la mer géante au-dessus de sa tête.
LIVRE III
[Endymion parle à Glaucus au fond de la mer.]

Sur un rocher couvert de ronces était assis ce vieillard,
Sa chevelure blanche était effrayante, et une natte
D'herbes fraîches gisait sous ses pieds froids et efflanqués;
Ample comme le plus large linceul,
Un manteau d'azur recouvrait ses vieux os,
Dans la trame duquel étaient symbolisées les incantations les plus ténébreuses
[Pg 226]De l'ambitieuse magie: chaque état de l'Océan
S'y dessinait distinctement en noir; l'orage,
Le calme, le murmure, le hideux rugissement
Etaient figurés sur le tissu; toute forme
Qui rase l'eau, plonge, sommeille entre les caps.
La baleine vorace ne semblait qu'un point dans le travail féerique,
Puis soudain, regardez: elle s'enflait et se gonflait
Jusqu'à son énormité naturelle; et le plus chétif poisson
Surpassait l'attente de l'observateur le plus minutieux,
Et montrait l'anatomie de son œil minuscule.
Là était peinte la royauté
De Neptune; et les Nymphes de la mer autour de son trône,
Telles de belles vassales, regardaient et attendaient.
A côté de ce vieillard était une baguette de perles,
Et sur ses genoux un livre qu'il étudiait
Avec tant d'attention, que le nouvel hôte des mers
Eut le temps de l'examiner longuement, stupéfait,
Et de noter toutes ces nuances, frappé de respect.

Le vieillard leva sa tête humide de buée et vit
L'étranger étonné—semblant ne pas voir,
Tant la vie était absente de sa physionomie. Soudain
Il s'éveilla comme d'une extase; ses sourcils blancs comme la neige
S'arquèrent, et comme fouillées par une charrue magique
[Pg 227]Des rides sillonnèrent profondément son large front,
Qu'il tenait aussi immobile que le sommet d'un roc,
Jusqu'à ce que sur ses lèvres flétries parut un sourire.
Alors il se redressa, comme un être accablé d'ennui
Qui, bien des années, aurait guetté dans une retraite abandonnée,
Et depuis le milieu de sa vie jusqu'à l'âge le plus avancé
N'aurait pas soulagé son âme avide de sons, en parlant
Même aux arbres. Il se leva, il saisit sa robe,
Puis d'une étreinte convulsive, il l'agita au vent...
[Glaucus raconte sa jeunesse à Endymion: «Il aimait la nymphe Scylla que Circé jalouse a tuée. Lui-même cédant à l'amour de la meurtrière fut réduit en l'état où le voit celai qui l'écoute. Cependant un étranger doit l'aider à reconquérir et Scylla et sa jeunesse». Qui ne devine immédiatement que ce mystérieux sauveur et Endymion ne font qu'un? Ils se rendent donc tous deux dans un palais sous-marin où, depuis des siècles, sont couchés côte à côte jeunes hommes et jeunes femmes qui se sont noyés par amour. Scylla est parmi ces dernières, et Endymion la ressuscite ainsi que ses nombreux compagnons d'infortune. Tous vont alors témoigner leur reconnaissance à Neptune et célébrer sa générosité.]

LIVRE IV
[Endymion, de nouveau solitaire, rencontre une jeune Indienne qui, elle aussi, a été malheureuse, et lui raconte ses infortunes. Avec l'hymne à Pan du premier livre, ce récit est la meilleure partie du poème:]

O tristesse
Pourquoi empruntes-tu
Les nuances naturelles de la beauté, à des lèvres vermeilles?
[Pg 228]Est-ce pour donner la rougeur des vierges
Aux buissons de roses blanches?
Ou est-ce ta main humide qui emperle la marguerite?

O tristesse
Pourquoi empruntes-tu
L'éclair étincelant à l'œil du faucon?
Est-ce pour donner au ver luisant sa lueur?
Ou, par une nuit sans lune
Pour, sur les rivages des sirènes, teinter les vagues de phosphorescence?

O tristesse
Pourquoi empruntes-tu
Les harmonieuses ballades aux voix plaintives?
Est-ce pour, dans les soirées blafardes,
Les donner au rossignol?
Et pouvoir l'écouter sous la fraîcheur de la rosée?

O tristesse
Pourquoi empruntes-tu
La légèreté du cœur au joyeux temps de Mai?
Un amoureux ne foulerait pas
La tête d'une primevère,
Quand même il danserait du soir jusqu'à l'aube—
Ni aucune fleur languissante
Conservée pieusement pour ton bocage,
N'importe où il s'amuse ou se divertisse.

[Pg 229]La tristesse
J'ai salué
Et pensais à l'abandonner très loin derrière moi;
Mais gaiement, gaiement,
Elle m'aime tendrement
Elle m'est si fidèle, et si accueillante.
Je voudrais la décevoir
De façon à l'abandonner
Mais, ah! elle est si fidèle et si accueillante.

Sous mes palmiers, au bord de la rivière,
Je m'assis pour pleurer: dans tout le vaste univers
Il n'y avait personne qui me demandât pourquoi je pleurais—
De sorte que je remplis
Jusqu'au bord le calice du nénuphar avec des larmes
Aussi glacées que mes terreurs.

Sous mes palmiers, au bord de la rivière
Je m'assis pour pleurer: quelle fiancée amoureuse,
Abusée par un chimérique amant descendu des nuages,
Ne se cache et ne se réfugie pas
Sous les sombres palmiers, au bord de la rivière?

Et, comme j'étais assise, par delà les claires collines bleues
J'entendis le vacarme de gens ivres: les ruisseaux
Amenaient dans le large fleuve des flots pourpres—
C'était Bacchus et sa troupe!
[Pg 230]La trompette lançait des notes ardentes, et les gazouillements argentins
Du choc des cymbales faisaient un joyeux bruit—
C'était Bacchus et sa famille!

Telle une bande de vendangeurs ils descendaient,
Couronnés de verts feuillages, la figure en feu;
Tous dansaient follement à travers la riante vallée.
Au point de te chasser, Mélancolie!
Oh alors! oh alors! tu n'étais qu'un simple mot!
Et je t'oubliai, comme le houx à baies rouges
Est oublié par les bergers, lorsqu'en Juin,
Les grands châtaigniers masquent le soleil et la lune:
Je me ruai dans la folie!

Sur son char, debout, se tenait le jeune Bacchus,
Agitant son sceptre de lierre, en des poses de danseur,
Avec des rires furtifs;
De petits filets de vin cramoisi coulaient
Sur la blancheur de ses bras potelés, et de ses épaules, assez blanches
Pour s'attirer la morsure de Vénus aux dents de perle:
A ses côtés à califourchon sur son âne, Silène
Lançait des fleurs comme il passait
Buvant goulument.

D'où veniez-vous, joyeuses filles! d'où veniez-vous!
Si nombreuses, et si nombreuses, en telle liesse?
[Pg 231]Pourquoi avez-vous déserté vos bocages attristés,
Vos luths et votre aimable sort?
—Nous suivons Bacchus! Bacchus agile,
Bacchus conquérant,
Bacchus, le jeune dieu! dans la bonne ou mauvaise fortune,
Nous dansons devant lui en traversant les vastes empires:
Venez aussi, belle vierge, et joignez-vous
A notre orchestre fantasque!»

D'où veniez-vous, gais Satyres, d'où veniez-vous?
Si nombreux, et si nombreux, en telle liesse?
Pourquoi avez-vous déserté vos bois favoris, pourquoi avez-vous laissé
Vos noisettes cachées dans les fissures des chênes?
—C'est pour le vin, pour le vin que nous avons quitté nos amandiers;
Pour le vin que nous avons quitté nos bruyères et nos genêts dorés,
Et les froids champignons;
Pour le vin nous suivons Bacchus à travers la terre;
Le Dieu puissant des coupes sans fond et des chants d'allégresse!
Venez aussi, belle vierge, et joignez-vous
A notre orchestre frénétique!»

Les larges rivières et les hautes montagnes nous avons franchi,
[Pg 232]Et sauf quand Bacchus se retirait sous sa tente de lierre,
En avant haletaient le tigre et le léopard
Avec les éléphants d'Asie:
En avant ces myriades d'êtres—chantant et dansant,
Avec les zèbres striés, les chevaux lustrés et fringants de l'Arabie,
Les alligators aux pieds palmés, les crocodiles,
Portant sur leurs dos des écailles, en files,
Des enfants potelés et rieurs mimant la manœuvre
Des matelots et le rude labeur des galériens:
Avec des avirons minuscules et des voiles de soie, ils glissent
Insouciants des vents et des marées.

Couchés sur les fourrures des panthères et les crinières des lions,
Tantôt à l'avant tantôt à l'arrière du cortège ils parcourent les plaines;
Et font en un instant un voyage de trois jours:
Et toujours au lever du soleil,
A travers les déserts ils chassent avec la lance et le cor
Le rhinocéros en fureur.

J'ai vu l'Osirienne Egypte s'agenouiller
Devant la couronne de vigne tressée!
J'ai vu l'aride Abyssinie se lever et chanter
En frappant les cymbales d'argent!
J'ai vu la vendange triomphante embraser de sa chaleur
La vieille et sauvage Tartarie!
[Pg 233]Les rois de l'Inde abaissent leurs sceptres constellés de joyaux,
Et de leurs trésors, répandent une pluie de perles;
Du haut de son ciel mystique le grand Brahma gémit,
Et tous ses prêtres se lamentent;
Ils pâlissent devant le regard du jeune Bacchus.
J'arrivai à sa suite dans ces régions
Le cœur malade—lassée—j'eus alors la fantaisie
De m'égarer au milieu de ces mornes forêts
Seule sans compagnon:
J'ai fini, j'ai dit tout ce que vous pouviez entendre.

Jeune étranger!
J'ai été une vagabonde
En quête du plaisir sous tous les climats:
Hélas, il n'est pas pour moi!
Je dois sûrement être ensorcelée,
Pour perdre dans la douleur tout mon printemps de vierge

Viens donc, Tristesse!
Tristesse très douce!
Comme mon propre baby je te nourris dans mon sein;
Je pensais à t'abandonner
Et à te décevoir,
Mais maintenant de tout l'univers c'est toi que j'aime le mieux.
Il n'y en a aucun,
Non, non, aucun
[Pg 234]Comme toi pour consoler une malheureuse délaissée,
Tu es sa mère,
Tu es son frère,
Et son époux, et son amant dans l'ombre.»
[Endymion ému de tant d'infortunes, oublie l'inconnue qu'il a cherchée pendant les trois premiers livres et s'éprend de la jeune Indienne, laquelle, ne fait qu'une seule et même personne avec la dite inconnue, qui est une déesse, Cynthia ou Diane.

Pour conclure, Endymion et Cynthia se jurent un amour éternel, étreignent Péona et disparaissent dans l'éther; alors]

... Péona regagna
Sa retraite à travers la forêt toute émerveillée.

Comme une licence en entraîne une autre, il a dû également se substituer au poète et relier entre eux les différents épisodes qui, par suite, auraient paru sans liens.

[Pg 235]

ISABELLE OU LE POT DE BASILIC
CONTE D'APRÈS BOCCACE
I

Gracieuse Isabelle, pauvre innocente Isabelle!
Lorenzo, un jeune pèlerin sous l'œil de l'Amour!
Ils ne pouvaient habiter la même demeure
Sans émotion au cœur, sans souffrance;
Ils ne pouvaient s'asseoir aux repas sans éprouver
Quelle douceur pour l'un était la présence de l'autre;
Ils ne pouvaient, à coup sûr, dormir sous le même toit
Sans rêver l'un à l'autre et pleurer chaque nuit.

II

Chaque matin leur amour devenait plus tendre,
Et chaque soir plus profond et plus tendre encore;
Lui ne pouvait, à la maison, au champ, au jardin, rien témoigner,
[Pg 236]Mais son visage à elle était tout son horizon;
Et la voix de l'aimé était toujours plus agréable
A l'aimée que le bruit des arbres ou des ruisseaux ombragés;
Les cordes de son luth faisaient sonner son nom,
Elle le dessinait sur sa broderie inachevée.

III

Il devinait quelle gentille main tournait le loquet,
Avant que la porte ouverte ne la découvrît à ses yeux;
A travers la fenêtre de sa chambre il surprenait sa beauté
D'un regard plus perçant que celui du faucon;
Régulièrement il la guettait aux vêpres,
Sachant que ses yeux étaient levés vers les mêmes cieux;
Il passait toute la nuit dans une attente enfiévrée,
Pour entendre sur l'escalier son pas matinal.

IV

Un long mois de Mai passé dans ce pénible état
Rendit leurs joues plus pâles lorsque Juin commença:
«Demain je me courberai devant ma joie,
Demain j'implorerai la faveur de ma dame».
«O puissé-je ne jamais voir une autre nuit,
Lorenzo, si tes lèvres ne prononcent pas le mot amour.»
[Pg 237]Ainsi chacun parlait à son oreiller; mais, hélas! chacun
Laissait passer jours sur jours sang goûter le suprême bonheur;

V

Si bien que les joues de la charmante Isabelle privées de baisers
Pâlirent tout comme le feraient les roses;
Devinrent aussi maigres que celles d'une jeune mère, qui cherche
Par quelque chant berceur à calmer la douleur de son enfant:
«Comme elle souffre» se dit-il, «je ne peux parler,
Et cependant je le veux, je lui déclarerai tout mon amour:
Si ses yeux expriment qu'il l'a vaincue, je boirai ses larmes,
Et du moins ses tourments cesseront.»

VI

Ainsi pensait-il en une radieuse matinée, et tout le jour
Son cœur battait à se rompre contre sa poitrine:
Et au dedans de lui il suppliait son cœur de lui donner
Le courage de parler; mais toujours son sang se figeait,
Etouffait sa voix, et chassait sa résolution—
[Pg 238]Exaltait l'idée qu'il se faisait d'une telle fiancée,
Lui donnait même la douce humilité d'un enfant:
Hélas! la passion au contraire est à la fois douce et sauvage!

VII

Ainsi, une fois de plus, il aurait passé dans l'angoisse et l'insomnie
Une terrible nuit d'amour et de misère,
Si les yeux vifs d'Isabelle n'avaient été fiancés
Avec chaque pensée reflétée sur son front;
Elle le vit couleur de cire et pâle comme un mort,
Puis soudain tout rougissant; aussi murmura-t-elle tendrement:
«Lorenzo!»—là elle interrompit sa timide requête,
Mais dans son ton et son regard il devina le reste.

VIII

«O Isabelle, je m'aperçois à demi
Que je peux confier ma souffrance à ton oreille;
Si jamais tu peux croire à quelque chose,
Crois à mon amour, crois que mon cœur
Est près de s'arrêter: je ne voudrais pas t'irriter
En pressant ta main malgré toi, ni blesser
Tes yeux en les fixant; mais je ne peux vivre
Une nuit de plus sans t'avouer ma passion.

[Pg 239]IX

«Amour! tu me délivres de l'hiver glacial,
Jeune fille! tu me mènes vers la chaleur de l'été,
Il me faut donc goûter la floraison qui s'épanouit
Dans la chaude maturité de ce gracieux matin.»
Il dit, et ses lèvres timides tout à l'heure, s'enhardirent,
Un baiser chanta poétiquement, humide de rosée:
Une grande béatitude, une extase s'éleva en eux,
Telle une fleur de volupté sous la caresse de Juin.

X

En se quittant, ils semblaient marcher dans les airs,
Roses jumelles momentanément séparées par le zéphir
Pour se retrouver plus unies et partager
Le ravissement parfumé de leur deux cœurs.
Elle, rentrée dans sa chambre entonna un hymne
A la gloire du délicieux amour et de sa flèche aussi douce que le miel;
Lui, allègrement gravit la colline vers le couchant,
Et salua le soleil d'un adieu, le cœur comblé de joie.

XI

De très près il se réunirent encore avant que le crépuscule
Eût, devant les étoiles, enlevé son voile complaisant,
[Pg 240]De très près ils se réunirent chaque soir, avant que le crépuscule
Eût devant les étoiles, enlevé son voile complaisant,
Secrètement dans un berceau d'hyacinthe et de musc,
Inconnu de tous, à l'abri des bavardages.
Ah! Plût au ciel qu'il en eût toujours été ainsi,
Et que des oreilles oisives n'aient pas trouvé plaisir à leurs infortunes.

XII

Furent-ils malheureux alors?—Cela ne peut être—
Trop de larmes ont été versées sur les amants,
Trop de soupirs furent poussés en leur faveur,
Trop de pitié leur fut accordée après leur mort,
Trop d'histoires douloureuses lisons-nous
Dont le thème serait mieux traduit en or resplendissant;
Excepté dans la page sublime où l'épouse de Thésée
Sur les vagues sans traces[1] se pencha pour le voir.

XIII

Mais, soyons juste envers l'amour.
Un peu de bonheur fait oublier beaucoup de tristesse;
Didon resta silencieuse sous son bosquet,
La détresse d'Isabelle fut extrême,
[Pg 241]Cependant le jeune Lorenzo ne fut pas embaumé avec des épices
De l'Inde torride, cette vérité est incontestable—
Même les abeilles, ces petites mendiantes des berceaux printaniers
Savent que la plus grande abondance de suc se trouve dans les fleurs empoisonnées.

XIV

La mignonne amoureuse habitait avec ses deux frères
Enrichis par le commerce de leurs ancêtres,
Pour eux, plus d'une main lassée s'humectait de sueur
Dans les mines éclairées de torches ou dans les bruyantes factoreries,
Plus d'un dos frémissant d'orgueil se courbait
Et saignait sous l'aiguillon du fouet; les yeux creux,
Aveuglé, plus d'un passait des jours entiers dans la rivière,
Pour récolter les grains d'or roulés par les flots,

XV

Pour eux, le plongeur de Ceylan retenait sa respiration,
Et s'exposait sans défense à la voracité des requins;
Pour eux le sang jaillissait de ses oreilles; pour eux, mourant,
[Pg 242]Sur la froide glace, le phoque aboyait lugubrement
Et gisait criblé de dards; pour eux seuls se consumaient
Des milliers d'hommes en proie à des tourments innombrables:
Semi-barbares, ils tournaient nonchalamment une roue.
Instrument de torture qui tranchait, broyait, écorchait vif.

XVI

Pourquoi étaient-ils fiers? parce que de leurs fontaines de marbre
L'eau coulait avec plus de faste que ne font les larmes des malheureux?
Pourquoi étaient-ils fiers? parce que leurs montagnes d'orangers
Etaient d'une ascension plus facile qu'un escalier de lépreux?
Pourquoi étaient-ils fiers? parce que leurs livres de comptes à raies rouges
Etaient plus luxueux que les chants de l'antiquité grecque?
Pourquoi étaient-ils fiers? nous le demandons encore bien haut,
Pourquoi, au nom de la Gloire, étaient-ils fiers?

XVII

Cependant ces deux Florentins s'étaient emmurés
Dans leur orgueil dévorant et leur couardise rapace
[Pg 243]Autant que deux Juifs côte à côte dans la terre sainte.
Barricadés comme dans un enclos contre les regards épieurs des mendiants;
Oiseaux de proie des forêts fournisseuses de mâts—mules infatigables
Et bâtées, colportant ducats et vieux mensonges—
Aux griffes agiles, s'abattant sur les passants sans défiance,—
On les admirait en Espagne, en Toscane, en Malaisie.

XVIII

Comment se fit-il que ces mêmes teneurs de livres purent épier
La gracieuse Isabelle dans sa couche duvetée?
Comment purent-ils découvrir dans les yeux de Lorenzo
Un obstacle à son labeur? Torride plaie d'Egypte
Dans leur horizon de cupidité et d'astuce!
Comment purent ces sacs d'argent regarder à l'Est et à l'Ouest?
Pourtant ils le firent—et tout bon joueur
Doit regarder derrière lui, comme le lièvre chassé.

XIX

O éloquent et fameux Boccace!
Nous implorons maintenant ton pardon comme une faveur,
[Pg 244]Et le pardon des myrthes aux émanations parfumées,
Des levers de lune chers aux amants,
Et des lis, qui croissent plus pâles
Maintenant qu'ils n'entendent plus les sons de ta lyre;
Pardonne nous de risquer des mots qui conviennent mal
A cette triste pause dans une aventure si digne de pitié.

XX

Accorde ton pardon sur l'heure, ensuite le conte
Se déroulera paisiblement, au point où il en est;
Il n'y a pas d'autre crime, de folle tentative.
De rendre plus douce la vieille prose par des rimes modernes:
Mon but,—que mes vers y réussissent ou échouent,—
Est de t'honorer, de saluer ton génie qui n'est plus;
De te substituer un chant en langue anglaise,
Tel un écho de toi résonnant sous le souffle du Nord.

XXI

Ces deux frères ayant découvert à de nombreux indices
Quel amour Lorenzo portait à leur sœur,
Et combien elle l'aimait aussi, chacun échangea
Avec l'autre ses plus amers soupçons, presque fou de penser
[Pg 245]Que lui, le serviteur chargé de leurs affaires,
Fût l'heureux possesseur de l'amour de leur sœur,
Quand leur dessein était de la mener peu à peu
A quelque haut seigneur et ses bois d'oliviers.

XXII

Et ils tinrent plus d'un conciliabule jaloux,
Et plus d'une fois à part se mordirent les lèvres,
Avant d'avoir arrêté l'expédient le plus sûr
Pour faire expier son crime au jeune amoureux;
A la fin, ces deux hommes pétris de cruauté
Tranchèrent la Pitié d'une entaille profonde jusqu'à l'os:
Car ils résolurent, dans quelque obscure forêt
De tuer Lorenzo, et de l'y enterrer.

XXIII

Ainsi, par une riante matinée, comme il se penchait
Au lever du soleil, par dessus la balustrade
De la terrasse du jardin, vers lui ils dirigèrent
Leurs pas à travers la rosée; et lui dirent:
«Vous semblez heureux et satisfait ici,
Lorenzo, et nous sommes désolés de troubler
Votre paisible méditation; mais si vous êtes sage,
Enfourchez votre coursier pendant qu'il fait encore frais.

[Pg 246]XXIV

Nous avons le projet, à l'instant même
D'éperonner, trois lieues, vers les Apennins;
Descends, nous t'en prions, avant que le soleil brûlant
Ne pompe son humide rosée sur l'églantine.»
Lorenzo, courtoisement comme il en avait l'habitude,
Avec déférence s'inclina devant ces paroles vipérines
Et partit à la hâte, pour se tenir tout prêt,
Avec sa ceinture, ses éperons et son pourpoint de chasse.

XXV

Et comme ils traversaient la cour,
Chaque trois pas il s'arrêtait, pour écouter
S'il n'entendrait pas le refrain matinal de sa dame,
Ou le léger bruit de son doux pas;
Et comme il était ainsi absorbé dans sa passion,
Il entendit un rire harmonieux au-dessus de lui;
Alors, levant la tête, il vit son visage brillant
Sourire à travers une baie en treillage, tout joyeux.

XXVI

«Mon amour, Isabelle», dit-il, «je craignais
De ne pouvoir t'adresser un tendre adieu:
[Pg 247]Ah! si j'allais te perdre, pendant que contraint
Je suis d'étouffer mon pesant chagrin
D'être séparé de toi trois tristes heures? mais nous regagnerons
Dans l'amoureuse obscurité ce que le jour nous fait perdre.
Adieu! Je serai bientôt de retour». «Adieu», dit-elle:
Et comme il s'éloignait, elle chantait heureuse.

XXVII

Ainsi les deux frères et leur victime
Sortirent à cheval de la belle Florence, où l'Arno rapide
Tourbillonne entre ses berges resserrées, et s'agite éperdument
En formant des cascatelles, tandis que la brême
Tient tête au courant. Pâles et blêmes
Paraissaient les figures des frères gagnant le gué,
Celle de Lorenzo rougissait d'amour. Ils passèrent l'eau
Et pénétrèrent dans une forêt propice au meurtre.

XXVIII

Là fut tué et enterré Lorenzo,
Là dans cette forêt prit fin son grand amour;
Ah! quand une âme gagne ainsi sa délivrance,
Elle souffre dans la solitude,—est mal à l'aise dans la paix,
[Pg 248]Comme les limiers couverts de sueur après l'hallali:
Ils trempèrent leurs épées dans l'eau, et firent galoper sans merci
Leurs chevaux pour rentrer, éperonnant furieusement,
Chacun d'eux plus riche en étant meurtrier.

XXIX

Ils contèrent à leur sœur comment, en soudaine hâte,
Lorenzo s'était embarqué pour des rivages étrangers;
Cette grande urgence était nécessitée
Par leurs affaires que requéraient des mains fidèles.
Pauvre fille! revêts ton voile de veuve étouffant,
Et sois libérée sur le champ des maudits liens de l'Espérance;
Aujourd'hui tu ne le verras plus, ni demain,
Et le jour suivant sera un jour de deuil.

XXX

Elle pleure solitaire sur ses plaisirs perdus;
Douloureusement elle pleura jusqu'à la venue de la nuit,
Puis alors, au lieu d'amour, o misère!
Elle médita solitaire sur la volupté:
Il lui semblait voir son image dans l'obscurité,
Elle répondait au silence par un doux gémissement,
[Pg 249]Etreignant l'air de ses beaux bras,
Et sur sa couche murmurant tout bas: «Où donc? où donc?»

XXXI

Mais l'égoïsme, cousin de l'Amour, n'imposa pas longtemps
Sa brûlante insomnie en son sein seulement;
Elle se consuma dans l'attente de l'heure fortunée et compta
Les instants fièvreusement, haletante, sans relâche—
Pas longtemps—car bientôt sur son cœur une infinité
De tourments plus nobles, une douleur plus aiguë
S'abattit tragiquement; passion insurmontable,
Et cruelle inquiétude pour les voyages de son amant.

XXXII

Au milieu de l'automne, vers le soir,
Le souffle de l'hiver arrive de très loin,
Le vent empoisonné de l'Ouest dépouille sans trêve
Les arbres de leur teinte dorée, siffle la ronde
De mort parmi les buissons et les feuilles,
Il dénude tout avant d'oser s'élancer
Hors de ses cavernes du Nord. De même la douce Isabelle
Par un dépérissement graduel perdit sa beauté,

[Pg 250]XXXIII

Parce que Lorenzo ne revenait pas. Souvent
Elle demandait à ses frères, l'œil éteint,
S'efforçant de rester brillant, quelle contrée
Pouvait le retenir si longtemps prisonnier! ils inventaient
De temps en temps un conte pour la tranquilliser. Leur crime
Etait sur leur tête, comme la fumée sur la vallée de Hinnom;
Et chaque nuit dans leurs rêves ils gémissaient tout haut,
De voir leur sœur dans son linceul de neige.

XXXIV

Car elle était morte dans une ignorance assoupissante,
Mais pour une chose plus mortellement lugubre que tout;
Cela vint comme un amer breuvage, bu par hasard,
Qui délivre le malade du fastueux drap mortuaire
En lui rendant quelques instants le souffle; comme une lance
Eveillant un Indien de son hypnotisme, nuageux palais,
[Pg 251]D'un coup féroce, et lui ramenant
Le sens du feu dévorateur au cœur et au cerveau.

XXXV

Ce fut une vision. Dans l'engourdissante obscurité,
Dans la tristesse de minuit, aux pieds de sa couche
Lorenzo se tenait, et pleurait; la tombe de la forêt
Avait souillé sa luisante chevelure qui autrefois lançait
Ses éclats jusqu'au soleil, et mis sa froide empreinte
Sur ses lèvres, et brisé le suave luth
De sa voix rendue au silence; le long de ses oreilles fangeuses
Un lit de boue était creusé par ses larmes.

XXXVI

Etrange fut le son que fit vibrer l'ombre blafarde;
Car elle s'efforçait, cette langue digne de pitié,
De parler comme lorsque sur terre elle était éveillée,
Isabelle, haletante, écoutait cette musique
Languissante et secouée de hoquets,
Comme le chant d'une harpe druidique aux cordes distendues;
On y percevait les lamentations en sourdine d'un spectre,
Telles les rauques rafales nocturnes parmi les ronces des sépulcres.

[Pg 252]XXXVII

Ses yeux, quoique farouches, cependant tout brillants d'humidité
Et d'amour, éloignaient toute l'épouvante que cause un revenant
A une malheureuse fille, tant leur lueur était magique.
Pendant qu'il détissa l'horrible trame
Des lugubres derniers jours,—la haine homicide
De l'orgueil et de l'avarice—le funèbre toit de pins
Sur la forêt—et le vallon au frais gazon,
Où, sans un mot, il tomba mortellement frappé.

XXXVIII

Ajoutant: «Isabelle! ma bien-aimée!
De rouges airelles s'inclinent sur ma tête,
Et une énorme pierre pèse sur mes pieds;
Autour de moi les hêtres et les châtaigners élevés répandent
Leurs feuilles et leurs coques hérissées de piquants; le bêlement des brebis
Arrive d'au delà du fleuve jusqu'à mon lit.
Vas, répands une larme sur ma fougère en fleurs,
Et cela me consolera au fond de mon tombeau.

[Pg 253]XXXIX

Je suis une ombre maintenant, hélas! hélas!
Sur les confins de l'humaine nature demeurant
Seul: seul je chante la sainte Messe
Agenouillé tandis qu'autour de moi tintent de menus sons de vie,
Que de chatoyantes abeilles volent à midi vers les champs,
Et que plus d'une cloche de chapelle annonce l'heure,
Me transperçant de douleur: ces sons deviennent étranges pour moi,
Et tu es loin de moi parmi les humains.

XL

Je sais ce qui était. Je ressens pleinement ce qui est,
Et je deviendrais fou, si les esprits le pouvaient;
Pourtant j'oublie le goût de la félicité terrestre,
Cette pâleur réchauffe ma tombe, comme si par moi
Un séraphin sortant des noirs abîmes avait été choisi
Pour me servir d'épouse: ta pâleur me rend heureux;
Ta beauté enveloppe tout mon être, et je sens
Un amour plus puissant pénétrer mon essence.»

[Pg 254]XLI

L'Esprit murmurant: «Adieu»—se dégagea, et laissant derrière lui
L'insaisissable obscurité lentement disparut;
De même que, tirés à minuit d'un sommeil réparateur,
Pensant aux heures rudes et à l'infructueux labeur,
Nous appuyons nos yeux dans le renfoncement de l'oreiller,
Et voyons dans les ténèbres des étincelles jaillir et sautiller,
De même, la triste Isabelle, les paupières douloureuses,
A la venue de l'aurore s'éveilla en sursaut;

XLII

«Ah! Ah! dit-elle. Je n'ai pas connu cette cruelle vie.
Je croyais que le pire était la pauvreté;
Je croyais que quelque Destin nous départissait plaisir et tourment
Par portions égales—jours de joie ou jours de deuil;
Mais voilà le crime—voilà le poignard sanglant d'un frère!
Doux Esprit, tu as instruit ma jeunesse:
Pour cela, je te rendrai visite, j'embrasserai tes yeux
Et te remercierai au ciel matin et soir.»

[Pg 255]XLIII

Quand le jour fut tout à fait levé, elle avait combiné
Comment elle pourrait secrètement gagner la forêt;
Comment elle pourrait retrouver les restes, qu'elle estimait si chers,
Et leur chanter une dernière berceuse;
Comment sa courte absence pourrait passer inaperçue,
Pendant qu'elle vérifierait la réalité du rêve.
Bien décidée, elle prit avec elle sa vieille nourrice
Et se dirigea vers cette funeste forêt mortuaire.

XLIV

Voyez comme elles se glissent le long de la rivière,
Comme elle chuchotte bas avec la vieille femme,
Et après avoir parcouru du regard la vaste plaine,
Comme elle lui montre le poignard: «Quelle fièvre hectique, quelle flamme
Te consume, enfant?—Quel bonheur peut-il t'advenir,
Que tu souries encore?» Le soir tomba
Et elles avaient découvert la couche terrestre de Lorenzo;
La pierre était là, les airelles se penchaient sur sa tête.

[Pg 256]XLV

Qui n'a rôdé dans un verdoyant cimetière,
Et laissé son esprit, comme un génie taupe,
Fouiller le sol argileux et le dur gravier
Pour voir un crâne, des os dans le cercueil et la robe funéraire;
Prenant en pitié chaque forme qu'a souillée la voracité de la Mort,
Et lui insufflant encore une fois une âme humaine?
Ah! ceci est une fête en comparaison de ce qu'éprouvait
Isabelle s'agenouillant devant Lorenzo.

XLVI

Ses regards sondaient la terre fraîchement remuée, comme si
Un simple coup d'œil pouvait surprendre tous ses secrets:
Distinctement elle vit, comme d'autres auraient reconnu
Des membres livides au fond d'une source de cristal;
Sur le lieu du meurtre elle semblait prendre racine,
Tel un lis né dans le vallon:
Alors, avec un poignard, soudain, elle commença
A creuser avec plus d'ardeur que les avares ne le peuvent.

[Pg 257]XLVII

Bientôt elle déterra un gant boueux, sur lequel
Avec la soie sa fantaisie avait brodé de pourpres dessins,
Elle le baisa de ses lèvres plus froides que le marbre,
Et le mit dans son sein où il se sécha
Et glaça complètement jusqu'à l'os
Les suaves mamelles créées pour apaiser les cris des enfants:
Puis elle recommença à fouiller, sans répit
Si ce n'est pour écarter de temps en temps le voile de ses cheveux.

XLVIII

La vieille nourrice se tenait à côté d'elle, étonnée,
Jusqu'à ce qu'elle se sentît le cœur ému de pitié
A la vue d'un si pénible labeur,
Alors elle s'agenouilla aussi, malgré ses mèches blanches
Et prêta ses mains décharnées à cette horrible besogne;
Trois heures elles peinèrent sur ce douloureux travail;
Enfin elles touchèrent le fond de la fosse
Sans qu'Isabelle perdît son calme ni son sang froid.

[Pg 258]XLIX

Hélas! à quoi bon toutes ces histoires de vermines?
Pourquoi s'attarder si longtemps près de cette tombe béante?
Oh! pour la grâce d'un Roman d'autrefois,
La plainte ingénue d'un chant de ménestrel!
Aimable lecteur, jette un coup d'œil sur le vieux conte,
Car ici, en vérité, il ne sied pas
De dire:—Oh! tourne-toi vers le véritable conte[2],
Et goûte le charme de cette pâle vision.

L

D'un stylet plus émoussé que le glaive de Persée
Elles tranchèrent, non la tête d'un monstre informe,
Mais une tête, dont la beauté s'harmonisait merveilleusement
Avec la mort comme avec la vie. Les anciens bardes ont dit:
L'amour ne meurt jamais, mais vit, dieu immortel:
Si l'amour personnifié est jamais mort,
Isabelle l'embrassa et gémit à voix basse.
C'était l'amour; froid—mort, c'est vrai; mais toujours dieu.


[Pg 259]LI

Anxieuses pour leur secret, elles emportèrent la tête chez elles
Où la récompense fut pour la seule Isabelle:
Elle lissa la chevelure en désordre avec un peigne d'or,
Autour de chaque œil plus creusé encore par la mort
Elle fixa des boucles comme des cils; et la glaise gluante,
Avec des larmes aussi glacées que le suintement d'une source
Elle l'enleva; puis de nouveau elle peigna et
Soupira tout le jour—puis de nouveau elle embrassa et pleura.

LII

Ensuite dans une écharpe d'or—parfumée avec la rosée
De fleurs précieuses, cueillies en Arabie,
Et les divines liqueurs distillées en gouttes odorantes
A travers les tuyaux serpentins rafraîchissants—
Elle l'enveloppa; et pour tombe lui choisit
Un pot de fleurs, dans lequel elle l'enfouit,
La recouvrant de terre; et par dessus elle planta
Un basilic fleuri, que ses larmes arrosèrent à jamais.

[Pg 260]LIII

Elle oublia les étoiles, la lune, le soleil,
Elle oublia l'azur nu-dessus des arbres,
Elle oublia les vallées où coulent les ruisseaux,
Elle oublia la brise glaciale de l'automne;
Elle n'avait aucune notion de la fin des journées
Et ne discernait pas leur recommencement; mais en paix
Se penchait sur son basilic en fleur immuablement,
Et le trempait de ses larmes jusqu'à la racine.

LIV

Ainsi elle le nourrit sans trêve de ses larmes amères,
Qui le rendirent gras, vert et florissant
Au point que son baume surpassa celui de ses semblables
Les autres touffes de basilics de Florence; car il tirait,
En plus, sa nourriture et sa vie, d'un forfait humain,
De cette tête devenue pourriture cachée à tous les regards
Au point que ce joyau, en sûreté dans son écrin,
Prospéra au grand jour et s'épanouit en feuilles parfumées.

[Pg 261]LV

O Mélancolie, demeure avec nous pour un instant!
O Musique, Musique, reprends haleine tristement!
O Echo, Echo, de quelque sombre rive,
Inconnue, Léthéenne, soupire vers nous—O soupire!
Esprits de deuil, relevez vos têtes, et souriez;
Relevez la tête, suaves Esprits, avec accablement,
Et jetez une faible lueur dans vos ténèbres funéraires,
Teintant avec la pâleur de l'argent le marbre des tombes.

LVI

Gémissez ici, vous toutes, syllabes qui exprimez le malheur
Et que clame le gosier profond de la triste Melpomène!
Faites résonner la lyre de bronze sur le mode tragique,
Faites vibrer les cordes mystérieusement;
Sifflez lugubrement plus haut que les vents, et sourdement;
Car la naïve Isabelle doit bientôt habiter
Le royaume des morts; elle se fane comme un palmier
Qu'entaille un Indien pour sa sève embaumée.

[Pg 262]LVII

O laisse le palmier se faner de lui-même;
Ne permets pas au froid hiver de geler son agonie!
Cela ne peut être—ces riches adorateurs de Babel,
Ses frères, remarquaient la continuelle averse
Qui coulait de ses yeux morts; et plus d'un curieux lutin,
Parmi ses parents, s'étonnait qu'une telle dot
De jeunesse et de beauté fût dédaignée, étant l'apanage
D'une fille prédestinée à devenir la fiancée d'un seigneur.

LVIII

Bien plus, ses frères s'étonnaient davantage
De la voir languir à côté du Basilic verdoyant,
Et de voir celui-ci s'épanouir, comme par miracle;
Grandement ils se demandaient ce que cela signifiait:
Ils ne pouvaient sûrement pas croire qu'une chose
De si peu de valeur eût le pouvoir de lui faire oublier
Sa propre jeunesse, et les gais plaisirs,
Et jusqu'au souvenir de l'amour anéanti.

LVIX

Aussi épièrent-ils le moment où ils pourraient pénétrer
Le mystère de ce caprice; et longtemps ils épièrent en vain;
[Pg 263]Car rarement elle se présentait au confessionnal,
Et rarement elle éprouvait la sensation de la faim;
Et quand elle quittait son trésor, elle rentrait à la hâte, aussi vite
Qu'un oiseau volerait pour revenir couver ses œufs;
Aussi patiente qu'une poule, elle s'asseyait
A côté de son Basilic, pleurant à travers ses cheveux.

LX

Ils imaginèrent donc de voler le pot de Basilic
Et de l'examiner dans un endroit secret:
Ce n'était que pourriture verdâtre et livide,
Et cependant ils reconnurent le visage de Lorenzo:
Ils avaient récolté la récompense de leur crime,
Si bien qu'ils désertèrent Florence sur l'heure
Pour n'y plus jamais retourner. Ils partirent au loin
Avec du sang sur leur tête, en exil.

LXI

O Mélancolie, détourne les yeux!
O Musique, Musique, reprends haleine tristement!
O Echo, Echo, quelqu'autre jour
Des îles Léthéennes, soupire vers nous—O soupire!
Esprits de deuil, ne chantez pas votre «Bon voyage!»
Car Isabelle, la douce Isabelle, va mourir;
[Pg 264]Elle va mourir d'une mort trop solitaire et incomplète
Puisqu'on lui a dérobé son cher Basilic.

LXII

Lamentablement elle regardait les choses mortes et inanimées,
Réclamant amoureusement son Basilic perdu;
Et avec les accents mélodieux dans les cordes
De sa voix expirante, maintes fois elle pleurait
Sur le pèlerin à l'âme errante,
Pour lui demander où était son Basilic; et pourquoi
On le lui cachait «Car c'est cruel», disait-elle,
«De me dépouiller de mon pot de Basilic»

LXIII

C'est ainsi qu'elle dépérit, qu'elle mourut de désespoir,
Implorant pour son Basilic jusqu'au dernier soupir.
Il n'y eut pas un cœur à Florence qui ne prît
En pitié son amour, dont la fin avait été si tragique.
De cette histoire naquit une plaintive ballade
Qui passant de bouche en bouche parcourut tout l'univers:
On en chante encore le refrain: «Quelle cruauté
De me dépouiller de mon pot de Basilic!»

[Pg 265]

LA VEILLE DE SAINTE-AGNÈS
I

La veille de Sainte Agnès—Ah quel frimas cruel sévissait!
Le hibou, malgré toutes ses plumes, était transi;
Le lièvre boitait en frissonnant sur le givre du gazon,
Et silencieux était le troupeau en son bercail laineux:
Engourdis étaient les doigts de l'intercesseur, pendant qu'il récitait
Son rosaire, et pendant que son haleine gelée,
Comme de l'encens sacré fumant d'un vieil encensoir,
Semblait s'envoler vers le ciel, sans pour cela qu'il y eût mort,
Devant le portrait de la douce Vierge, tandis qu'il disait sa prière.

[Pg 266]II

Il disait sa prière cet homme patient, cet homme saint;
Soudain saisissant sa lampe, il se lève de dessus ses genoux,
Et retourne en arrière, maigre, nu-pieds, hâve,
Le long de la chapelle latérale, à pas lents:
Les morts sculptés de chaque côté semblent grelotter,
Emprisonnés dans l'obscurité, derrière des grilles de purgatoire:
Comtes, dames, priant dans ce silencieux oratoire,
Il passe devant; et son faible esprit défaille
En pensant combien ils doivent souffrir sous leurs capuchons et leurs cottes de mailles glacés.

III

Vers le Nord il traversa une petite porte,
Et fit à peine trois pas, que la langue dorée de la Musique
Toucha jusqu'aux larmes ce pauvre vieillard;
Mais non—déjà son glas de mort avait tinté;
Les joies de sa vie entière étaient dites et chantées;
C'était pour lui dure pénitence la veille de Sainte-Agnès:
Il prit un autre chemin, et bientôt au milieu
[Pg 267]De cendres grossières il s'assit pour le repos de son âme,
Et toute la nuit resta éveillé, peinant pour le salut des pécheurs.

IV

Ce vétuste Intercesseur entendit l'harmonieux prélude,
Pendant lequel, par les nombreuses portes largement béantes
La foule se hâtait ça et là. Bientôt, du haut des voûtes
Les trompettes d'airain firent sonner leurs grondements retentissants:
Les salles du bas, préparées avec splendeur,
Brillaient pour recevoir un millier d'hôtes:
Les anges sculptés, les yeux éternellement flamboyants,
Avaient le regard fixé là où sur leurs têtes repose la corniche,
Les cheveux rejetés en arrière, les ailes en croix sur la poitrine.

V

Un long cortège se précipita en ornements argentés,
Avec plumes, tiare, et tout son riche apparat,
Nombreux comme les ombres qui hantent fantastiquement
Le cerveau, fraîchement imprégné dans la jeunesse, des joyeux triomphes
[Pg 268]D'antiques romances. Pour ceux là souhaitons leur disparition,
Et tournons notre pensée exclusivement vers une dame,
Dont le cœur avait été plein, tout ce jour d'hiver,
De l'amour et du culte sacré de Sainte Agnès ailée,
Ainsi qu'elle l'avait maintes fois entendu déclarer par de vieilles femmes.

VI

Elles lui avaient dit comment la veille de Sainte Agnès,
De jeunes vierges pouvaient avoir des visions de délices,
Et recevoir les tendres aveux de leurs amants,
A l'heure de minuit au parfum de miel,
Si elles exécutaient ponctuellement les cérémonies requises;
Comment, sans souper elles devaient se mettre au lit,
Puis étendre leurs beaux corps, blancs comme des lis;
Sans regarder derrière, ni de côté, mais implorer
Du ciel, les yeux tournés vers lui, tout ce qu'elles désiraient.

VII

Absorbée dans cette fantaisie était la songeuse Madeline:
La musique gémissait comme un Dieu supplicié,
Elle l'entendait à peine: ses yeux divins de jeune fille
[Pg 269]Fixés sur le plancher, voyaient plus d'une troupe passer
Rapidement devant elle—elle n'y faisait pas attention: en vain
Se présenta, sur la pointe du pied, plus d'un amoureux cavalier,
Et se retira. Ce n'était pas le froid du mépris hautain,
Mais elle ne voyait pas, son cœur était ailleurs:
Elle aspirait aux rêves de Sainte-Agnès, les plus enchanteurs de l'année.

VIII

Elle trépignait dans l'attente, les yeux vagues, sans regards,
Les lèvres anxieuses, la respiration brève et haletante:
L'heure consacrée approchait: elle soupirait
Parmi les tambourins et la foule entassée
Qui chuchotait avec colère, ou avec gaîté;
Parmi les regards d'amour, de défiance, de haine, de dédain,
Aveuglée par son fantasque caprice: toute triste,
Ne pensant qu'à Sainte-Agnès, à ses agneaux sous leurs toisons,
Et à toute la félicité qui devait survenir avant le lendemain matin.

[Pg 270]IX

Ainsi, se proposant à chaque moment de se retirer,
Elle tardait encore. Pendant ce temps, traversant la lande,
Etait arrivé le jeune Porphyro, le cœur enflammé
Pour Madeline. Accoudé contre le portail d'entrée,
Arc-boutant éclairé par la lune, debout, il implore
Tous les saints de lui accorder de voir Madeline,
Ne fût-ce qu'une seconde, pendant ces pénibles heures,
Qu'il puisse la contempler et l'adorer, invisible pour tous;
Par aventure parler, s'agenouiller, toucher, baiser—en vérité que de telles joies surviennent,

X

Il s'aventure dans l'intérieur, qu'aucun bourdonnement ne le dénonce:
Que tous les yeux soient bandés, ou cent épées
Assailliront son cœur, fiévreuse citadelle de l'Amour:
Pour lui, sont bondées ces salles de hordes barbares,
D'ennemis sanguinaires, de lords au sang bouillant,
Dont les chiens hurleraient des exécrations
Contre sa race: pas un cœur qui lui accorde
Merci, dans cette demeure hostile,
Sauf une vieille douairière, faible de corps et d'esprit.

[Pg 271]XI

Quelle chance favorable! la créature âgée arrivait,
Traînant les pieds, s'appuyant sur un bâton à pomme d'ivoire,
Jusqu'à la place où il se tenait, hors de la lumière des torches,
Derrière un large pilier, bien loin
Des cris d'allégresse et des chants caressants:
Il la fit tressaillir; mais aussitôt elle le reconnut,
Et saisit ses doigts dans sa main tremblotante,
Disant: «Merci, Porphyro! quitte cette place;
Ils sont tous là cette nuit, cette race entière assoiffée de sang!

XII

«Sors! sors! Il y a là le nain Hildebrand;
Qui dernièrement fut pris de fièvre, et dans un accès
T'a maudit toi et les tiens, la demeure et tes terres;
Il y a ici le vieux Lord Maurice, que ses cheveux
Gris ne rendent pas plus humain—Hélas! fuis!
Fuis comme un fantôme.»—«Ah, chère commère,
Nous sommes suffisamment en sûreté, assieds-toi ici dans ce fauteuil,
Et dis moi comment ...?»—«Grands Saints! pas ici! pas ici!
Suis moi, enfant, ou ces pierres seront ta tombe.»

[Pg 272]XIII

Il la suivit cheminant sous des voûtes basses,
Effleurant les toiles d'araignée avec sa haute plume,
Et comme elle marmottait «Bien—nous voilà arrivés!»
Il se trouva dans une petite pièce éclairée par la lune,
Blafarde, treillagée, froide et silencieuse comme un cercueil.
«Maintenant, apprends moi où est Madeline», dit-il
«Apprends-le moi, Angela, par le métier sacré
Que seule peut voir la communauté secrète
Quand les sœurs tissent pieusement la laine de Sainte-Agnès.»

XIV

«Sainte-Agnès! Ah! c'est la veille de Sainte-Agnès—
Cependant des hommes seront assassins pendant des jours sacrés:
Il te faut garder de l'eau dans un crible de sorcière,
Et te rendre le Seigneur-lige des Elfes et des Fées,
Pour t'aventurer ainsi: cela me remplit d'étonnement
De te voir, Porphyro!—La veille de Sainte-Agnès!
Que Dieu nous assiste: ma jolie dame joue le rôle de magicienne
Cette nuit: que les bons anges l'abusent!
Mais laisse-moi rire un peu, j'ai bien le temps de pleurer.»

[Pg 273]XV

Faiblement elle rit sous la languissante lune,
Pendant que Porphyro regardait sa figure,
Comme un bambin interloqué devant une affreuse mégère
Qui tient clos son merveilleux livre d'énigmes,
Tandis que les lunettes sur le nez, elle s'assied au coin de l'âtre.
Mais bientôt ses yeux devinrent brillants lorsqu'elle dévoila
Le projet de sa dame; et il pouvait à peine retenir
Ses larmes, à la pensée de ces froids sortilèges,
Et de Madeline endormie dans le sein des vénérables légendes.

XVI

Soudain une pensée lui vint comme une rose épanouie,
Qui rougit son front, et dans son cœur peiné
Fit s'enflammer son sang: alors il propose
Un stratagème qui fait frémir la vieille femme:
«Tu es un homme cruel et impie:
Douce dame, laisse la prier, dormir, rêver
Seule avec ses anges gardiens, loin, très loin
Des hommes méchants comme toi. Va, va! J'estime
Que tu n'es sûrement le même que tu semblais être.»

[Pg 274]XVII

«Je ne lui ferai aucun dam, par tous les saints je le jure.»
Allégua Porphyro; «O puissé-je ne jamais trouver grâce
Lorsque ma faible voix murmurera sa prière dernière,
Si je dérange une seule de ses boucles soyeuses,
Ou regarde avec une convoitise brutale son visage;
Bonne Angéla, crois-moi, par ces larmes;
Ou je vais, à l'instant même,
Réveiller, d'un horrible cri, les oreilles de mes ennemis,
Et les défier, quoiqu'ils soient plus fangeux que des loups et des ours.»

XVIII

«Ah! pourquoi vouloir effrayer une âme affaiblie?
Une pauvre chose débile, frappée de paralysie, guettée par le cimetière,
Dont la cloche qui passe peut sonner le glas avant minuit;
Dont les prières pour toi, matin et soir,
N'ont jamais été oubliées.» Geignant ainsi, elle obtint
Des paroles plus calmes du brûlant Porphyro
Si malheureux, si profondément affligé,
Qu'Angéla lui promit qu'elle ferait
Tout ce qu'il désirait, quel que fût le bien ou le mal qui en résultât pour elle;

[Pg 275]XIX

C'est-à-dire, qu'elle le conduirait, dans le plus grand mystère,
Jusqu'à la chambre même de Madeline, et là le cacherait
En un cabinet, tellement secret
Qu'il pourrait contempler sa beauté sans témoins,
Et peut-être gagner cette nuit une incomparable fiancée,
Tandis que des légions de fées veillaient sur son couvre-pied
Et qu'un pâle enchantement la tenait assoupie.
Jamais amants n'eurent de nuit si propice,
Depuis que Merlin paya à son Démon toute sa monstrueuse dette.

XX

«Il sera fait selon ce que tu désires» dit la Duègne:
«Gâteaux et friandises de toutes sortes seront réunis là
Rapidement pour cette fête de nuit: par la fente du tambour
Tu verras son propre luth: il n'y a pas de temps à perdre,
Car je suis lente et usée, et j'ose à peine
Pour de tels préparatifs m'en fier à ma tête étourdie.
Attends ici, mon enfant, avec patience, agenouille-toi et prie
[Pg 276]Pendant ce temps: Ah! tu dois absolument épouser la dame,
Ou puissé-je ne jamais quitter mon tombeau d'entre les morts.»

XXI

Ce disant, craintive, elle se hâte en clopinant.
Pour l'amoureux lentes et interminables s'écoulaient les minutes;
La femme revint et chuchota à son oreille
De la suivre; avec ses yeux éraillés exprimant la stupeur
Et l'épouvante d'être épiée dans l'ombre. Saufs enfin,
A travers de nombreuses galeries obscures, ils atteignent
La chambre de la jeune fille, soyeuse, silencieuse et chaste;
Là Porphyro trouva sa retraite, plein de joie.
Son pauvre guide s'en retourna à la hâte, le cerveau en fièvre.

XXII

La main tremblante sur la balustrade,
La vieille Angéla tâtait pour atteindre les marches,
Lorsque Madeline, cette adoratrice charmée de Sainte Agnès,
Surgit, comme un esprit en mission, à l'improviste:
S'éclairant d'un flambeau d'argent, avec un soin pieux,
Elle retourna et fit redescendre la vieille commère
[Pg 277]Jusqu'à ce qu'elle fût en sûreté sur un tapis uni. Maintenant prépare-toi,
Jeune Porphyro, regarde avec attention ce lit!
Elle vient, elle revient, telle une palombe qui s'effraie et s'envole.

XXIII

Comme elle se hâtait, le flambeau s'éteignit;
Sa petite fumée, clair de lune évanescent, mourut:
Elle ferma la porte, palpitante, en alliance intime
Avec les esprits de l'air et les vastes visions:
Qu'elle ne prononce pas une syllabe, ou, malheur à elle!
Quant à son cœur, son cœur parlait avec volubilité,
Tourmentant éloquemment son flanc embaumé;
De même un rossignol, privé de sa langue, gonflerait
Son gosier en vain, et mourrait, le cœur étouffé, dans son vallon.

XXIV

Il y avait une haute croisée à trois arcades
Toute enguirlandée d'imitations sculptées
De fruits, de fleurs et de gerbes de graminées,
Avec des vitres en losange d'une bizarre invention,
Riche en couleurs et en teintes splendides,
Comme sont les ailes sombres et damasquinées[1] du papillon de nuit;
[Pg 278]Et, au milieu entre mille figures héraldiques,
Entre des saints noyés dans le crépuscule et de ternes blasons,
Un écusson—bouclier rougissant du sang des reines et des rois.

XXV

En plein sur cette croisée miroitait la lune hivernale,
Qui dardait de brûlants rayons baisant le beau sein de Madeline,
Comme elle s'agenouillait pour implorer grâce et faveur du ciel;
Ils coloraient en rose ses mains, jointes ensemble,
Et en délicate améthyste sa croix d'argent,
Ils entouraient sa chevelure d'un nimbe, telle une sainte:
Elle semblait un ange éblouissant, qu'on vient de vêtir,
Sauf les ailes, pour qu'il monte au ciel:—Porphyro se sentit défaillir:
Elle était agenouillée, créature si pure, si dégagée de toute apparence mortelle.

XXVI

Vite, il reprend ses esprits: ses prières achevées,
Elle délivre ses cheveux de sa couronne de perles;
Détache un à un ses joyaux encore chauds,
Dégrafe son corsage parfumé; peu à peu
[Pg 279]Ses riches ajustements glissent en bruissant jusqu'à ses genoux:
A moitié cachée, comme une sirène dans les algues,
Pensive un instant elle rêve éveillée et voit
En imagination la divine sainte Agnès en son lit,
Mais n'ose regarder derrière elle; tout le charme s'envolerait.

XXVII

Bientôt, tremblante dans son nid moelleux et glacé,
En une sorte d'évanouissement éveillé, inquiète elle s'étend,
Jusqu'à ce que la chaleur endormante du sommeil oppressât
Ses membres apaisés et son âme lassée,
Sublimée, comme une pensée, jusqu'au lendemain;
Abritée en un bienheureux port contre joies et tristesses;
Fermée comme un missel dans lequel prient les sombres Païens;
Egalement inaccessible à la pluie et à l'ardeur du soleil,
Telle une rose repliant ses pétales, puis redevenant bouton.

XXVIII

Introduit furtivement dans ce paradis, en extase,
Porphyro contemplait les vêtements vides de Madeline,
L'écoutant respirer, pour discerner si par hasard
[Pg 280]Elle était plongée en un doux assoupissement;
Lorsqu'il l'eut constaté, il bénit cette minute,
Et respira lui-même: alors il se glissa hors de son refuge
Muet comme la crainte dans une sauvage immensité,
Puis sur le tapis étouffeur de sons, sans bruit, il avança
Et regarda à travers les rideaux, là, oh! combien profondément elle dormait.

XXIX

Alors à côté du lit, où la lune s'effaçant
Laissa une lueur de crépuscule argentée, doucement il plaça
Une table, et à moitié angoissé, jeta dessus
Une étoffé tissée de rouge, d'or et de jais:
Amulette pour quelque somnolent Morpheien!
Le tapageur et joyeux clairon de Minuit,
La timbale, et la trompette entendue au loin,
Effraient ses oreilles, bien que dans une sonorité mourante:
La porte d'entrée se referme de nouveau et tous les bruits cessent.

XXX

Et toujours elle dormait d'un sommeil aux cils azurés,
Dans la toile blanche et fine, fleurant la lavande,
Quand de sa cachette il rapporta un monceau
[Pg 281]De pommes candies, de coings, de prunes, de courges,
Puis des gelées plus savoureuses que le lait caillé,
Et des sirops rutilants, colorés avec de la cannelle;
De la manne et des dattes, transportées par mer,
Cueillies à Fez; et des friandises aromatisées, préparées chacune,
De la soyeuse Samarcande au Liban couvert de cèdres.

XXXI

Il entassait ces sucreries d'une main fiévreuse
Sur des plats en or et dans des corbeilles reluisantes
D'argent tressé; somptueuses elles s'élevaient
Dans la paisible retraite de la nuit,
Remplissant la chambre glacée d'un parfum subtil,
«Et maintenant, mon amour, mon gracieux séraphin, éveille-toi!
Tu es mon paradis et je suis ton ermite:
Ouvre les yeux, pour le salut de la bienheureuse sainte Agnès,
Ou je vais m'endormir pour toujours à tes côtés, tant mon âme est dolente».

XXXII

Ce disant, il enfonça son bras brûlant et flexible
Sous l'oreiller de Madeline, dont le rêve était masqué
[Pg 282]Par l'ombre des rideaux: c'était un enchantement de minuit,
Qui ne pourrait se fondre comme un torrent gelé:
Les plateaux étincelants reflétaient les rayons de la lune;
Une large frange dorée était étalée sur le tapis:
Il semblait que jamais, jamais il ne pourrait délivrer
D'un charme si puissant les yeux de sa bien-aimée;
Tellement il était absorbé et enlacé dans la trame de ses rêveries.

XXXIII

Revenant à lui, il saisit le luth creux de la dormeuse—
Tumultueux—et sur les cordes les plus tendres,
Il joua une vieille ballade, oubliée depuis longtemps,
Appelée en Provence «La Belle Dame sans mercy».
Faisant chanter la mélodie tout près de son oreille;
Troublée par cette musique, elle balbutia une faible plainte:
Il s'arrêta—aussitôt elle devint haletante—et soudain
Ses yeux bleus effrayés brillèrent grands ouverts:
Il se précipita à genoux pâle comme une sculpture en marbre bien poli.

XXXIV

Ses yeux étaient ouverts, cependant elle voyait encore
Quoique tout à fait éveillée, la vision qui hantait son sommeil:
[Pg 283]Ce fut un douloureux changement, qui chassa presque
La béatitude de son rêve si pur et si profond.
A cette idée la mignonne Madeline se mit à pleurer,
Et proféra des mots dépourvus de sens entrecoupés de nombreux soupirs;
Tout en conservant les yeux fixés sur Porphyro;
Celui-ci agenouillé, les mains jointes et les yeux suppliants,
Craignait de remuer ou de parler, tellement elle semblait rêver.

XXXV

«Ah! Porphyro!» dit-elle, «tout à l'heure encore
Ta voix vibrait délicieusement à mon oreille,
Chaque doux serment qu'elle prononçait la rendait harmonieuse;
Et ces tristes yeux étaient vifs et clairs:
Combien tu es changé! combien blême, froid et morne!
Enchante-moi de ta voix encore, mon Porphyro,
De tes regards immortels, de tes chères lamentations!
Oh! ne me laisse pas dans ce malheur éternel,
Car si tu meurs, mon amour, je ne sais où me réfugier!»

XXXVI

Enflammé comme jamais mortel ne le fut
Par ces accents voluptueux, il se leva,
[Pg 284]Transfiguré, rougissant, semblable à une étoile scintillante
Vue parmi les saphirs dans les calmes profondeurs du ciel;
Il se fondait dans son rêve, comme la rose
Mêle son parfum à celui de la violette,
Suave dissolution: sur ces entrefaites le vent du Nord souffle
Comme un veilleur d'Amour, chassant les flèches du grésil
Contre les vitres de la croisée; la lune de sainte Agnès a disparu.

XXXVII

Il fait noir: rapide frappe le grésil pulvérisé par la bise:
«Ce n'est pas un rêve, ma fiancée, ma Madeline!»
Il fait noir: les rafales glacées font rage et se ruent;
«Pas un rêve! Hélas! Hélas! quel malheur est le mien!
Porphyro me laissera ici languir et me flétrir.
Cruel! Quel traître a pu t'amener ici?
Je ne maudis pas, car mon cœur est perdu dans le tien,
Quoique tu abandonnes une pauvre chose déçue;
Une colombe perdue, égarée, l'aile inégale et malade.»

XXXVIII

«Madeline mienne! douce rêveuse! adorable fiancée!
Dis-le, puis-je être pour toujours ton vassal fortuné?
[Pg 285]L'égide de ta beauté, en forme de cœur et couleur de sang?
Ah! châsse d'argent, c'est ici que je trouverai mon repos
Après tant d'heures de fatigues et de recherches,
Pèlerin affamé,—sauvé par miracle.
Quoique je l'aie découvert, je ne déroberai rien dans ton nid
Sauf toi-même, bien-aimée; si tu juges que c'est bien
De te fier, Belle Madeline, à un infidèle sans rudesse.

XXXIX

«Ecoute! C'est l'ouragan des elfes qui arrive du pays des fées,
Ils semblent farouches, mais en réalité sont bienfaisants:
Debout.—Debout! le matin est proche:
Les buveurs gorgés n'y prendront pas garde:
Eloignons-nous, mon amour, en joyeuse hâte;
Il n'y a ni oreilles pour entendre, ni yeux pour voir,—
Ils sont tous noyés dans le vin du Rhin et l'hydromel soporifique:
Réveille-toi! debout! mon amour, sois sans crainte,
Au delà des landes du Sud, j'ai pour toi un asile».

XL

A ces mots elle se précipita, harcelée d'angoisses,
Car tout alentour il y avait des dragons assoupis,
[Pg 286]Surveillant, le regard fixe, la lance prête pour foncer—
Descendant les larges escaliers, ils trouvèrent un chemin obscur.
Dans toute la maison on n'entendait aucun son humain.
Une lampe suspendue par une chaîne vacillait auprès de chaque porte;
Des tentures ornées de cavaliers, de faucons, de chiens,
Etaient agitées par le vent dont les assauts les secouaient;
Et les longs tapis se soulevaient le long des planchers balayés par l'orage.

XLI

Les amants glissaient comme des fantômes à travers le vaste hall;
Comme des fantômes, vers la porte de fer, ils glissaient,
Où gisait le portier inquiet, sur sa couche,
Avec un énorme broc vide à ses côtés:
Le vigilant limier se dressa, fronçant sa peau,
Mais son œil sagace reconnut un habitant du lieu:
Un à un, les verroux sont aiséments tirés:
Les chaînes retombent sur les dalles usées;
La clé tourne, et la porte tourne sur ses gonds.

XLII

Et les voilà partis: oui, il y a de longs âges
Que ces amoureux s'enfuirent au loin dans la tempête.
[Pg 287]Cette nuit-là le Baron rêva de plus d'un malheur,
Et tous les guerriers ses hôtes, ayant ombre et forme
De sorciers, de démons, de gigantesques vers rongeurs de cercueils,
Furent longuement hantés de cauchemars. La vieille Angela
Mourut frappée de paralysie, sa maigre face contorsionnée;
L'Intercesseur, après avoir dit un millier d'Ave,
N'étant plus requis pour prier, s'endormit parmi les cendres refroidies.

Janvier 1819.

[Pg 288]

LAMIA
Ire PARTIE
Autrefois, avant que la descendance des demi-dieux
Eût chassé les Nymphes et les Satyres des bois prospères,
Avant que le resplendissant diadème du Roi Oberon,
Que son sceptre, que son manteau agrafé avec un joyau en rosée,
Eussent expulsé les Dryades et les Faunes terrorisés
De leurs roseaux verdoyants, de leurs fourrés, de leurs clairières émaillées de primevères,
L'Hermès toujours enflammé[1] laissa vacant
Son trône d'or, pour se prosterner brûlant d'ardeur devant son amoureux larcin:
Du haut de l'Olympe il avait dérobé la lumière,
[Pg 289]De ce côté des nuées de Jupiter, pour échappera la vue
Et aux ordres impérieux de son maître, et s'était réfugié
Dans une forêt sur les rivages de la Crète.
Quelque part en cette île sacrée habitait
Une nymphe devant laquelle s'agenouillaient tous les Satyres aux sabots fourchus;
Aux pieds blancs de laquelle les langoureux Tritons répandaient
Des perles, tandis qu'à terre ils dépérissaient et l'adoraient.
Tout près de la source où elle aimait à se baigner,
Et dans ces prairies où il était possible que parfois elle errât,
Etaient parsemées de riches offrandes, qu'aucune Muse ne connaissait,
Quoique les écrins fussent ouverts pour que sa Fantaisie y fît son choix.
Ah! quel monde d'amour était à ses pieds!
Ainsi pensait Hermès, et un feu céleste,
L'embrasait de ses talons ailés à ses oreilles,
Qui, d'habitude blanches comme le lis clair,
Prenaient la teinte des roses au milieu de ses cheveux dorés,
Tombant en boucles jalouses sur ses épaules nues.
De vallon en vallon, de taillis en taillis, il volait,
Exhalant sur les fleurs sa passion nouvelle,
Et suivait les sinuosités de maintes rivières jusqu'à leurs sources,
[Pg 290]Pour découvrir l'endroit où cette douce nymphe préparait en secret sa couche.
En vain; nulle part il ne pouvait trouver la douce nymphe,
De sorte qu'il reposait en ce lieu écarté,
Pensif, plein d'amertume et de jalousie
Contre les Dieux Sylvains et même contre les arbres.
Comme il se tenait là, il entendit une voix si plaintive
Qu'après l'avoir entendue, en son noble cœur, fut remplacée
La souffrance par la pitié. Ainsi parlait cette voix solitaire:
«Quand m'éveillerai-je hors de cette tombe enguirlandée?
Quand pourrai-je me mouvoir dans un corps apte à jouir de la vie,
De l'amour et du plaisir, de la lutte vermeille
Du cœur et des lèvres! Ah, malheur à moi!»
Le Dieu aux ailes de colombe, glissa silencieusement
Parmi les buissons et les futaies, effleurant avec légèreté, dans sa hâte,
Les graminées les plus hautes et les roseaux en pleine floraison.
Il aperçut enfin, palpitant, un serpent
Etincelant, roulé en cercle dans l'obscurité des broussailles.

C'était une forme gordienne, d'une nuance éblouissante,
Mouchetée de vermillon, d'or, de vert et de bleu;
[Pg 291]Rayée comme un zèbre, tachetée comme un léopard,
Les taches imitant des yeux de paon, les raies toutes cramoisies;
Son écaille était pleine de lunes blanches, qui, à chaque respiration,
Pâlissaient, ou devenaient plus brillantes, ou alternaient
Leurs éclats avec des colorations plus ternes—
Ainsi, les flancs comme un arc-en-ciel, accablée de malheurs,
Elle semblait en même temps une elfe expiant ses fautes,
La fiancée de quelque démon, ou le démon lui-même.
Sur sa crête elle portait une lueur blafarde
Piquetée d'étoiles, comme la tiare d'Ariadne:
Sa tête était celle d'un serpent, mais quel charme ironique!
Elle avait une bouche de femme avec sa parure complète de perles:
Quant à ses yeux: que pouvaient ici faire de tels yeux
Si ce n'est pleurer, et pleurer de ce qu'ils étaient nés si beaux?
De même Proserpine pleure, regrettant la brise Sicilienne.
Sa gorge était celle d'un serpent, mais les paroles qu'elle proférait,
Comme à travers un bouillonnement de miel, évoquaient l'Amour;
C'était ainsi, tandis qu'Hermès s'appuyait sur ses ailerons,
Tel un faucon s'infléchirait avant de saisir sa proie:
[Pg 292]—Bel Hermès, couronné de plumes, au vol léger,
J'eus de toi un splendide rêve la nuit dernière:
Je te voyais assis sur un trône en or,
Parmi les Dieux, sur le vénérable Olympe,
Seul triste entre tous; car tu n'entendais pas
Les suaves, les claires vocalises que les Muses accompagnent sur le luth,
Ni même Apollon lorsqu'il chanta seul,
Sourd tu fus devant le long, long gémissement de sa voix sanglotante.
Je rêvais que je te voyais, paré d'écailles pourpres,
Emergeant plein d'amour du sein des nuages, comme émerge le matin,
Et rapidement comme un fulgurant javelot de Phœbus,
Pénétrant dans l'île de Crète; et t'y voilà maintenant!
Trop séduisant Hermès, as-tu trouvé la bien aimée?»
Aussitôt l'étoile du Léthé ne fit pas attendre
Sa réponse fleurie, et s'informa ainsi:
—Toi, serpent aux lèvres flatteuses, sûrement inspiré par le ciel!
Toi, guirlande de beauté, aux yeux mélancoliques,
Prouve que tu détiens toute la félicité que tu peux t'imaginer,
Apprends-moi seulement où ma nymphe s'est enfuie,
Où elle respire!»—Astre brillant, tu as bien parlé,
Reprit le serpent, mais lie-toi par un serment, aimable Dieu!»
—Je jure, dit Hermès, par mon caducée,
Et par tes yeux, et par ta couronne étoilée!»
[Pg 293]Légères volèrent ses chaleureuses paroles lancées parmi les fleurs.
Alors de nouveau se fit entendre la voix enchanteresse.
—Cœur trop sensible! ta nymphe perdue
Libre comme l'air, invisible, rôde
A travers ces déserts sans ronces; ses radieuses journées,
Elle les goûte sans être vue; elle n'est pas vue lorsque ses pieds agiles
Laissent des traces sur le gazon et les fleurs odorantes;
Des pampres chargés et des vertes ramures inclinées
Elle cueille les fruits sans être vue, elle se baigne sans être vue:
C'est par mon pouvoir que sa beauté est voilée
Pour demeurer hors d'affront, hors d'atteinte
Des regards d'amour jetés par les yeux peu dignes d'amour
Des Satyres, des Faunes, et des soupirs du chassieux Silène.
Son immortalité se consumait dans la répulsion
Que lui inspiraient tous ces adorateurs, et elle se plaignait tant
Que je pris pitié d'elle, lui recommandai de tremper
Ses cheveux dans des liqueurs magiques, qui conserveraient
L'invisibilité à ses charmes et lui permettraient
De folâtrer à sa fantaisie, en liberté.
Tu vas la contempler, Hermès, toi seul,
Si tu veux, ainsi que tu l'as juré, obtenir de moi cette faveur».
[Pg 294]Une fois encore, le Dieu séduit, renouvela
Son serment qui résonna à travers les oreilles du serpent,
Brûlant, frémissant, pieux, implorateur.
Ravie, elle releva sa tête Circéenne,
Se colora de l'incarnat de la vie, et balbutia hâtivement:
—J'étais une femme; qu'une fois de plus je prenne
La forme d'une femme aussi attrayante qu'autrefois.
J'aime un jeune Corinthien. O Félicité!
Rends-moi mon corps de femme, et transporte-moi où il est.
Courbe-toi, Hermès, laisse-moi souffler sur ton front
Et tu verras ta nymphe aimée à l'instant même».
Le Dieu se pencha confiant sur ses ailes à demi repliées,
Elle souffla sur ses yeux; aussitôt apparut devant eux
La nymphe sequestrée, souriante sur la pelouse.
Ce n'était pas un rêve, ou autant dire que c'en était un;
Les rêves des Dieux sont des réalités: paisiblement ils jouissent
De leurs plaisirs en un long rêve immortel.
Un moment plana sur eux, d'ardeur, de rougeur, pendant lequel il sembla
Emerveillé par la beauté de la nymphe sylvestre, tant il était enflammé;
Puis se posant sur la verdure sans y laisser d'empreinte, il se tourna
Vers le serpent pâmé, et d'un bras alangui,
Délicatement, il mit à l'épreuve le charme du flexible Caducée.
Après quoi, sur la nymphe il inclina ses yeux
[Pg 295]Pleins de larmes d'adoration et de caresse.
Il fit un pas vers elle; mais, telle une lune à son déclin,
Elle disparut petit à petit devant lui, s'affaissant; et sans pouvoir retenir
Ses sanglots angoissées, elle se repliait comme une fleur
Qui rentre en elle-même à l'heure du crépuscule:
Cependant, le Dieu protégeant sa main frissonnante,
Elle sentit sa chaleur, ses paupières se rouvrirent caressantes,
Et comme les fleurs nouvelles au bruissement matinal des abeilles,
Elle s'épanouit, et rendit son parfum à la brise.
Dans la profondeur des vertes frondaisons ils volèrent
Et jamais ne se refroidirent ainsi que font les amoureux mortels.

Laissée à elle-même la forme serpentine commença
A se transformer; son sang de sylphide follement circula,
Sa bouche écuma, et l'herbe ainsi humectée
Fut flétrie par cette rosée si enivrante et si virulente;
Ses yeux, rendus fixes par la douleur et une morne angoisse
Brûlants, vitreux, hagards, avec les cils des paupières collés,
Dardaient du phosphore et d'acérées étincelles, sans qu'une larme les rafraîchît.
Les tons de sa peau s'incendièrent le long de son corps;
Elle se tordit, convulsée en des souffrances écarlates:
[Pg 296]Le jaune soufre foncé remplaça
La couleur plus tendre de la lune qui ornait son corps gracieux,
Et,—telle la lave dévastant une prairie,—
Ternit ses écailles d'argent et ses tresses d'or,
Obscurcit ses taches fauves, ses stries et ses rayures,
Eclipsa ses croissants, éteignit ses étoiles;
Si bien qu'en quelques secondes elle fut dépouillée
De tous ses saphirs, ses émeraudes, ses améthystes,
Et de ses rubis argentés: toutes ces parures lui furent enlevées,
Il ne lui resta que la souffrance et la hideur.
Sa couronne gardait encore une lueur; celle-ci évanouie, sa forme aussi
Se fondit et disparut soudainement.
Alors, dans l'air, sa voix nouvelle résonnant avec tendresse,
Cria «Lycius! charmant Lycius!» Suspendues
Dans les brumes diaphanes enveloppant les antiques montagnes
Ces paroles s'évaporèrent: les forêts de Crète ne les entendirent jamais plus.

Où s'envola Lamia, devenue une dame resplendissante,
Une beauté de haute lignée, jeune et élégante?
Elle s'envola dans cette vallée que traverse
Tout voyageur qui va des rivages de Cenchrée à Corinthe;
Là, elle se reposa au pied de ces vastes collines
[Pg 297]D'où s'écoulent parmi les rochers, les ruisseaux de Pérée,
Puis au pied de cette autre cime dont les pentes stériles
S'étendent, voilées de brouillards et de nuées orageuses,
Dans la direction du Sud-Ouest jusqu'à Cléone. Ici elle s'arrêta,
A la distance environ d'un vol d'oiseau novice, près d'un bois
Hospitalier, sur la verdoyante déclivité d'un sentier moussu,
Au bord d'un étang limpide; alors elle se sentit émue
De se voir échappée à de si cruelles infortunes,
Tandis que sa robe flottait parmi les narcisses.

Oui, heureux Lycius! car c'était une fille plus belle
Qu'aucune autre qui tordît jamais sa natte,
Ou soupirât, ou rosît, ou sur une prairie aux fleurs printanières,
Déployât, pour chanter, son manteau vert:
Une vierge aux lèvres pures, et cependant, dans la science
De l'amour, très instruite jusqu'au fond de son cœur rouge[2]:
Ayant à peine une heure d'existence, et cependant assez rouée
[Pg 298]Pour garantir le bonheur contre les chagrins toujours proches,
Faire la part des moments d'humeur, éloigner
Les points de contact, rapidement échanger
Une intrigue contre un chaos plausible, et séparer
Ses atomes les plus ambigus avec un art sûr;
Comme si elle avait, à l'école de Cupidon, passé,
Charmant étudiant, de délicieuses journées sans être jamais punie,
Et conservé sa fraîcheur en un paresseux alanguissement.

Pourquoi cette gracieuse créature se décida si paisiblement,
A s'attarder le long de la route, nous allons le voir;
Mais d'abord il convient de dire comment elle pouvait méditer
Et rêver, alors qu'emprisonnée dans sa forme de serpent
Elle embrassait tout, l'étrange et le magnifique:
Comment, toujours, où elle voulait, son esprit volait;
Soit dans l'Elysée éthéré, soit dans le fond
Des vagues aux crêtes élevées, là où les belles Néréides
Penètrent dans le berceau de Thétis en gravissant des marches en perles,
Soit où le Dieu Bacchus vide sa divine coupe
Etendu nonchalamment sous un pin résineux;
Soit dans les jardins du palais de Pluton
[Pg 299]Là où les colonnes de Vulcain[3] brillent alignées à perte de vue.
Et parfois dans les cités elle transportait
Son rêve pour se mêler aux fêtes et aux révoltes;
Une fois, tandis qu'en rêve elle était parmi les mortels,
Elle aperçut le jeune Corinthien Lycius
Conduisant un char le premier, dans une course disputée,
Tel un jeune Jupiter calme, la figure sereine;
Et défaillant, elle tomba amoureuse de lui.
Maintenant à l'heure des phalènes et du clair obscur,
Il reprendrait cette route, elle le savait bien,
Pour revenir du rivage à Corinthe; car fraîchement soufflait
La douce brise de l'Est, et sa galère en ce moment
Heurtait de sa proue d'airain les quais en pierre,
Arrivant de l'île d'Egine, dans le port de Cenchrée
Récemment mouillée; là, il avait passé quelque temps
Pour sacrifier à Jupiter dont le temple en cette île
Laisse entrer par ses hautes portes les victimes et le précieux encens.
Jupiter écouta ses vœux et exauça son désir.
En effet, par un caprice du hasard il se tint à l'écart
De ses compagnons et marcha à l'aventure,
Peut-être lassé de leur bavardage Corinthien;
Il franchissait les collines désertes
[Pg 300]Sans penser à rien d'abord, mais avant qu'apparût l'étoile du soir
Sa fantaisie errait où la raison s'égare,
Dans le calme crépuscule des ombres Platoniciennes.
Lamia le vit approcher, près, plus près,
Passant tout contre elle, dans une noire indifférence,
Ses silencieuses sandales foulaient la mousse verte,
Si proche de lui, et cependant si invisible,
Elle demeurait immobile: il passa, absorbé dans les mystères,
L'esprit aussi fermé que son manteau; elle, des yeux,
Suivait ses pas, et tournant vers lui sa blanche nuque
De reine, elle s'écria:—Ah, séduisant Lycius!
Veux-tu donc m'abandonner seule sur ces collines?
Lycius, regarde derrière toi et montre quelque pitié.»
Il fit, ne témoignant ni froid étonnement, ni peur,
Mais comme un Orphée reconnaissant une Eurydice;
Car si mélodieux étaient les mots qu'elle chanta
Qu'il lui sembla l'avoir aimée tout un été;
Et bientôt ses yeux avaient bu sa beauté,
Ne laissant aucune goutte dans l'enivrante coupe;
Et toujours la coupe était pleine—mais lui, craignant
Qu'elle ne s'évanouît avant que ses lèvres n'eussent exprimé
L'adoration due, commença ainsi à l'adorer, tandis que
Modestement elle baissait les yeux, devinant que l'emprise était sûre:
—Te laisser seule! Regarder derrière moi! O, Déesse, vois
[Pg 301]Si mes yeux pourront jamais se détourner de toi
Par pitié! ne mens pas à ce triste cœur—
Car si tu disparaissais, je mourrais.
Reste! quoique Naïade des rivières, reste!
A tes désirs lointains, tes cours d'eau obéiront;
Reste! quoique les luxuriantes forêts soient ton domaine,
Sans toi elles peuvent s'abreuver de la pluie matinale:
Quoique tu sois une Pléiade descendue des cieux, aucune de tes
Harmonieuses sœurs ne maintiendra-t-elle en accord
Tes sphères, et comme ta mandataire ne jettera-t-elle une lueur argentée?
Si délicieusement ont frappé mes oreilles ravies
Tes promptes paroles de bienvenue, que si tu t'évanouissais
Ton souvenir me réduirait à l'état d'ombre;
Par pitié, ne te fonds pas dans l'espace!»—Si je restais,»
Dit Lamia, «ici, sur cette terre de boue,
Si je daignais fouler ces fleurs trop rudes pour mes pieds,
Que pourrais-tu dire et faire qui me captivât suffisamment
Pour amoindrir le souvenir enchanteur de mon paradis?
Tu ne peux me demander de vagabonder ici avec toi
A travers ces collines et ces vallées où il n'y a pas de joie,—
[Pg 302]Privée d'immortalité et de félicité!
Tu es un savant, Lycius, et dois savoir
Que les esprits supérieurs ne peuvent respirer ici-bas
Dans l'atmosphère humaine et y vivre. Hélas! pauvre enfant,
Quel parfum d'air plus pur as-tu pour charmer
Mon essence? Quels palais plus superbes
Dans lesquels tous mes nombreux sens puissent se plaire,
Et par de mystérieux sortilèges assouvir mes insatiables soifs?
Cela ne peut être. Adieu.» Ceci dit, elle se cambra
Sur la pointe des pieds, ses bras blancs déployés. Lui, frémissant de perdre
L'amoureuse promesse de sa solitaire lamentation,
Défaillait, balbutiant des mots passionnés, pâle, angoissé.
La cruelle, sans montrer aucune
Tristesse pour la douleur de son tendre favori,
Mais plutôt, si ses yeux pouvaient briller davantage,
Avec des yeux plus brillants et une exquise lenteur,
Joignit ses lèvres aux siennes et lui rendit
La vie qu'elle avait enserrée dans ses mailles;
Et comme il s'éveillait d'une extase pour entrer
Dans une autre, elle commença à chanter,
Heureuse en beauté, en vie, en amour, en toutes choses,
Une cantilène d'amour trop suave pour les lis terrestres,
Tandis que, tel un souffle retenu, les étoiles éteignirent leurs feux scintillants.
[Pg 303]Alors elle chuchota d'un ton tremblant semblable à celui
Que prennent ceux, qui réunis en lieu sûr, se rencontrant seuls
Pour la première fois, après de nombreux jours de tourments,
Usent d'autre langage que celui des yeux; elle le suppliait de relever
Sa tête découragée, et de délivrer son âme du doute,
Car elle était une femme, sans autre
Plus subtil fluide dans les veines
Que du sang palpitant; et les mêmes affres
Habitaient son fragile cœur a elle, et le sien.
Ensuite elle s'étonnait qu'il n'eut pas remarqué
Depuis longtemps sa figure à Corinthe, où dit-elle,
Elle demeurait dans une demi retraite, et où elle avait passé
Des jours aussi fortunés que peut en procurer la monnaie d'or
Sans l'aide de l'amour; heureuse cependant
Jusqu'au moment où elle le vit, lorsqu'une fois elle le coudoya.
Il était appuyé songeur contre une colonne
Sous le porche du temple de Vénus, au milieu d'un amas de corbeilles
D'herbes et de fleurs amoureuses fraîchement cueillies
Tard dans cette soirée; car c'était la nuit qui précédait
La fête d'Adonis; après, elle ne le revit plus,
[Pg 304]Mais pleura seule ces jours-là: pourquoi, en effet, l'adorerait-elle?
Lycius se réveillait de la mort pour tomber dans l'émerveillement
De la voir encore, et de l'entendre chanter de si douces chansons.
Puis à l'émerveillement succéda la joie
D'entendre si bien chuchoter sa sagesse de femme;
Et chaque mot qu'elle prononçait lui faisait ressentir
Une joie sans mélange et un plaisir intense.
Que les poètes dans leur folie disent tout ce qui leur plait
Sur les charmes des Fées, des Péris, des Déesses,
Aucune n'est un tel régal, parmi elles toutes,
Qu'elles hantent cavernes, lacs ou chutes d'eaux,
Qu'une femme réelle, qu'elle sorte
Des cailloux de Pyrrha ou de la semence du vieil Adam.
Ainsi la gracieuse Lamia jugea, et eut raison de juger
Que Lycius ne pourrait pas aimer tant qu'il serait à demi intimidé,
De sorte qu'elle rejeta au loin sa divinité, et gagna son cœur
Plus agréablement en jouant son rôle de femme,
Sans plus de pudeur que n'en comportait sa beauté
Qui, même dans le spasme, en sauvegardait une part suffisante.
Lycius fit à tout d'éloquentes répliques,
Mariant chaque mot d'un soupir jumeau;
[Pg 305]Enfin, désignant Corinthe, elle demanda à son amant
Si elle était trop éloignée, cette nuit, pour ses pieds délicats.
Le chemin fut court; Lamia dans son impatience
Réduisit, par un sortilège, les trois lieues
A quelques enjambées, sans être soupçonnée
Par Lycius aveuglé, tant elle le subjuguait.
Ils franchirent les portes de la ville, il ne sut pas comment,
Sans bruit, et jamais il ne s'inquiéta de le savoir.

Comme des hommes parlant en rêve, tous les Corinthiens,
A travers leurs palais impériaux,
Toutes leurs rues populeuses et leurs temples de débauche,
Murmuraient, telle une tempête se préparant à distance,
Sous la nuit étendue au-dessus de leurs tours.
Hommes, femmes, riches et pauvres, dans les heures fraîches,
Traînaient leurs sandales sur les dallages blancs,
Seuls ou par groupes; pendant que mainte lumière
Brillait çà et là, éclairant de somptueuses fêtes,
Et projetait des ombres mouvantes sur les murs,
Ou les trouvait amassés dans l'ombre des corniches
Sous la porte cintrée d'un temple ou une sombre colonnade.
[Pg 306]Se couvrant la face, par crainte d'amis qui le reconnaîtraient,
Il pressait nerveusement ses doigts, quand quelqu'un les frôla
Avec une barbe grise bouclée, les yeux investigateurs, le crâne chauve et lisse,
Marchant à petits pas, drapé dans une robe de philosophe:
Lycius, en le croisant et en passant, resserra plus étroitement
Son manteau, paraissant dans sa hâte avoir des ailes,
Tandis que Lamia affolée tremblait:—Ah, dit-il,
Pourquoi, mon amour, tressaillir si peureusement?
Pourquoi ta tendre main se fond-t-elle en moiteur?»
—Je suis épuisée, répondit la belle Lamia, dis-moi qui
Est ce vieillard? Je ne puis me rappeler
Ses traits; Lycius! pourquoi vous êtes vous dissimulé
Devant son vif regard?» Lycius répliqua:
—C'est Apollonius le sage, mon fidèle guide
Et mon bon précepteur; mais ce soir il semble
Le spectre de la folie qui hante mes doux rêves.»

Pendant qu'il parlait ainsi, ils atteignirent
Un porche à piliers avec une porte à haut vantail,
Où pendait une lampe d'argent dont la lueur phosphorescente
Se reflétait en bas sur les marches luisantes,
Atténuée comme une étoile dans l'eau; car si neuve
Et si nette était la nuance du marbre,
[Pg 307]Si pures comme un liquide transparent, à travers un cristal poli
Couraient les veines foncées, que nul si ce n'est un pied divin
Ne pouvait les avoir foulées. Des bruits Eoliens
Résonnaient à travers le gond, à l'instant où la large baie
De la porte ouverte découvrait un lieu que n'avait fréquenté
Depuis longtemps, aucun autre qu'eux deux,
Et quelques eunuques Persans, qui la même année
Avaient été vus sur les marchés: personne ne savait où
Ils pouvaient habiter; les plus curieux
Etaient déjoués, qui épiaient pour les dépister jusqu'à leur demeure:
Et cependant, les vers au vol rapide devront raconter
Par égard pour la vérité, quels malheurs les frapperont dans la suite,
Cela chagrinerait plus d'un cœur de les laisser ainsi
Ignorés du monde affairé de gens plus sceptiques.

IIe PARTIE
L'amour dans une chaumière, avec de l'eau et une croûte de pain
Est—Amour, pardonne-nous!—cendres, escarbilles, poussière:
L'amour dans un palais est peut-être à la longue
[Pg 308]Un supplice plus affreux qu'un déjeuner d'ermite:
Ceci est un conte nébuleux du pays des fées
Difficile à comprendre pour les non élus.
Si Lycius avait vécu pour transmettre son histoire
Il aurait pu donner à la morale un nouveau froncement de sourcil
Ou l'étrangler tout à fait: mais trop court fut leur bonheur
Pour nourrir la défiance et la haine qui fait siffler la douce voix.
De plus, là, nuitamment, jetant un regard de haine,
L'Amour, devenu jaloux d'un couple aussi uni,
Déploya, puis fit bruire ses ailes en un terrible grondement
Au-dessus du linteau de la porte de la chambre,
Tandis qu'en dessous filtrait un rayon sur le plancher.

Toutes ces circonstances amenèrent la catastrophe: côte à côte
Comme sur un trône, le soir, ils étaient
Couchés, abrités par un lambrequin
Dont l'étoffe aérienne, tissée de fil d'or,
Flottait à travers la salle, et laissait apparaître
Sans voile le ciel d'été, bleu et clair,
Entre deux fûts de marbre:—ils reposaient là
Où la lassitude leur avait procuré le doux sommeil, les paupières closes,
Sauf un mince interstice que l'amour conservait entr'ouvert
[Pg 309]Pour qu'ils pussent se voir pendant qu'ils étaient presque endormis;
Lorsque du flanc d'une colline suburbaine,
Couvrant le gazouillement de l'hirondelle, éclata une fanfare
De trompettes—Lycius sursauta—les sons s'envolèrent,
Mais laissèrent une pensée, un bourdonnement dans sa tête.
Pour la première fois, depuis qu'il avait trouvé asile
Dans ce palais, aux tentures pourprées, du doux péché,
Son esprit franchit ses limites dorées
Et, se parjurant presque, retourna dans le bruit du monde.
La dame, toujours en éveil, pénétrante,
Le remarqua avec chagrin, suspectant chez lui un désir
De plus, de plus que l'empire
De jouissances qu'elle lui donnait; et elle se mit à gémir et à soupirer
De ce que sa pensée vaguât loin d'elle, sachant bien
Qu'il suffit d'un moment de réflexion pour que tinte le glas de l'amour.
—Pourquoi soupirez-vous, divine créature? murmura-t-il
—Pourquoi réfléchissez-vous? riposta-t-elle tendrement:
Vous m'avez désertée;—où suis-je maintenant?
Pas dans votre cœur, pendant que le souci pèse sur votre front;
Non, non, vous m'avez expulsée, et j'erre hors
[Pg 310]De votre poitrine sans abri: ah! cela doit être ainsi!»
Il répondit, se penchant sur ses yeux ouverts,
Céleste miroir qui reflétait son image en raccourci.
—Planète mienne à la lueur d'argent, du soir et du matin!
Pourquoi vous affirmer ainsi une triste délaissée
Tandis que je m'efforce d'emplir mon cœur
D'un sang plus ardent, et d'une double flamme?
De fondre, de mêler, de lier
Votre âme avec la mienne et de vous retenir captive ici
Comme la senteur cachée dans une rose sans boutons?
Ah! un tendre baiser!... Vous, apprenez votre extrême infortune.
Mes pensées! faut-il les dévoiler? Ecoutez alors!
Tout ce qui est mortel n'a de prix,—et les autres hommes
Languissent et se fatiguent pour l'obtenir—
Que s'il se produit quelquefois, au grand jour, majestueusement
Et s'il triomphe, de même que je serai fier de toi
Au milieu des rauques clameurs poussées par les Corinthiens.
Que mes ennemis suffoquent, que mes amis crient au loin,
Pendant qu'à travers les rues encombrées, notre char nuptial
Fera tourner ses rais éblouissants!» La joue de la dame
Trembla; elle ne dit rien, mais, pâle et humble
Se leva pour s'agenouiller devant lui, versa un torrent
De larmes amères à ces paroles; enfin, douloureusement
[Pg 311]Elle l'implora, tout en pressant sa main
Pour qu'il abandonnât son projet. Il en fut piqué,
S'acharnant davantage dans son caprice pervers à contraindre
Sa sauvage et timide nature de lui obéir.
En outre, pour tout son amour, en dépit de lui-même,
Malgré la meilleure partie de lui-même, il éprouva une jouissance
Voluptueuse à la torturer, délicieuse et nouvelle.
Sa passion, devenue cruelle prit un ton
Féroce et sanguinaire, autant que cela était possible
A un être dont le front n'avait pas de veine noire à gonfler.
Admirable était ce délire mitigé; tel l'aspect
D'Apollon, lorsqu'il se prépare à frapper
Le serpent.—Ah! le serpent! Certes elle
Ne l'était pas. Consumée d'amour pour son tyran,
Et toute soumise, elle acceptait l'heure
Où il conduirait son amante à la cérémonie.
Chuchotant dans le silence de minuit, le jeune homme ajouta:
—Assurément, tu dois avoir un nom charmant, bien que, par ma foi,
Je ne te l'aie pas demandé, m'imaginant toujours
Que tu n'étais pas mortelle, mais d'origine céleste
Comme je le crois encore. As-tu un nom mortel,
Une appellation digne de ta forme éblouissante?
Ou des parents ou des amis dans une cité terrestre
Qui partagent notre banquet et nos réjouissances nuptiales?»
[Pg 312]—Je n'ai pas d'amis, dit Lamia; non, pas un;
Ma présence dans la vaste Corinthe est à peine connue:
Les ossements de mes aïeux reposent dans leurs urnes empoussiérées
Au fond du tombeau; aucun encens incandescent n'y brûle,
Puisque leur race infortunée a disparu toute entière, sauf moi;
Et encore, je néglige le rite sacré, à cause de toi.
Cependant, à votre choix invitez vos nombreux hôtes;
Mais si, comme il semble maintenant, votre vision s'attache
A moi avec quelque plaisir, ne prévenez pas
Le vieil Apollonius—tenez-moi cachée à ses yeux.»
Lycius, rendu perplexe par ces paroles si vagues et si obscures
Voulut poursuivre l'enquête; à la première allusion, elle recula,
Feignant de dormir; quant à lui, il fut envahi
Subitement par l'engourdissante torpeur d'un profond sommeil.

C'était la coutume alors d'emmener
La fiancée hors de sa maison, lorsque le crépuscule rougissait l'horizon,
Voilée, sur un char, accompagnée de fleurs
Jonchant le sol, de torches, de chants nuptiaux
Et d'autres pompes: mais cette belle inconnue
N'avait pas un ami. Ainsi, laissée seule.
[Pg 313](Lycius était allé convoquer toute sa famille,)
Ayant la certitude qu'elle ne parviendrait pas à dissuader
Son cœur obstiné de lui imposer cette folle cérémonie,
Elle s'assit très préoccupée par l'idée de couvrir
Sa misère d'une convenable magnificence.
Elle agit ainsi, mais on ignore d'où et comment
Vinrent, et quels furent ses subtiles serviteurs.
A travers les halls, dans des allées et venues,
On discerna un bruit d'ailes, jusqu'à ce qu'en quelques minutes
La salle de fête illuminée resplendît sous l'élégance des voûtes hardies.
Une musique captivante, peut-être le seul et unique
Point d'appui du toit magique, se fit entendre
Sans relâche, comme s'il était à craindre que tout le charme pût s'évanouir.
Des cèdres fraîchement taillés parodiant une futaie
De palmiers et de bananiers, s'élançant de chaque côté,
Formaient au centre une coupole élevée en l'honneur de la mariée.
Deux palmiers puis deux bananiers, et ainsi de suite,
De chaque côté enlaçaient leurs branches l'une à l'autre
Le long des bas côtés; et, au-dessous de tout cela,
Courait un ruissellement de lampes allant d'un mur à l'autre.
Sous ce dais se célébrait un banquet tel que personne n'en a goûté,
Dégageant des fumets rares. Lamia, en royal apparat,
[Pg 314]Silencieuse, se promenait à pas lents, et comme elle s'avançait
Blafarde, heureuse en quelque sorte d'être malheureuse,
Elle ordonnait à ses invisibles serviteurs de raviver sans cesse
Dans chaque coin et chaque niche la flamme dont l'éclat diminuait.
Entre les troncs des arbres, à des surfaces de marbre
Succédaient des panneaux de jaspe; puis, çà et là, émergeaient
Des silhouettes grimpantes de végétations plus sveltes,
Qui avec les cépées plus grandes s'entrelaçaient intimement.
Après avoir donné son approbation, elle disparut, suivant son caprice,
Dans sa chambre, et tira le verrou, apaisée et calmée,
Ayant repris son sang-froid et préparée à l'orgie brutale
Quand les hôtes redoutés entreraient pour violer sa solitude.

Le jour parut, et toutes les clameurs se turent.
Insensible Lycius! Fou! Pourquoi dédaigner
Le destin qui avec le silence t'apportait la félicité, les heures d'ardente intimité?
Pourquoi livrer aux yeux du vulgaire cette alcôve secrète?
Le troupeau approchait; chaque invité, le cerveau enfiévré
Arrivait sur le seuil, précipitait un coup d'œil
Et entrait stupéfait; car ils connaissaient la rue,
[Pg 315]Se la rappelaient depuis leur enfance d'un bout à l'autre,
Sans une lacune, et jusque-là n'avaient jamais remarqué
Ce porche royal, cette luxueuse demeure aux énormes dimensions.
Aussi tous se ruaient, étonnés, curieux, les yeux fougueux;
Un seul jetait sur le palais un regard sévère,
Puis d'un pas mesuré y pénétrait, l'air austère;
C'était Apollonius: il souriait même quelque peu,
Comme si quelque problème ardu, qui avait affolé
Ses patientes recherches, commençait maintenant à se dénouer
A se résoudre, à se fondre:—c'était juste ce qu'il avait prévu.

Il rencontra dans le vestibule au milieu de la rumeur
Son jeune disciple.—Ce n'est pas la règle commune,
Lycius, dit-il, qu'un hôte, sans être convié,
S'impose à vous, et trouble
En se présentant sans y être requis, la joyeuse cohorte
D'amis plus jeunes; et cependant je dois commettre cette infraction,
Et vous devez me pardonner.» Lycius rougit, et conduisit
Le vieillard à travers les portes intérieures larges ouvertes,
Cherchant par ses paroles de conciliation et sa mine courtoise
A tourner en lait sucré le spleen du sophiste.
[Pg 316]La salle du banquet était d'une éclatante opulence,
Eblouissante de lumière imprégnée d'effluves embaumées.
Devant chaque rutilant panneau, fumait
Un encensoir rempli de myrrhe et de bois épicé,
Chacun juché sur un trépied sacré
Dont les tiges frêles s'écartaient largement sur le moelleux
Tapis en tissu laineux; cinquante spirales de fumée
Au-dessus des cinquante encensoirs faisaient leur voyage aérien
Vers le haut plafond, se reflétant, à mesure qu'elles s'élevaient,
Sur les murs garnis de miroirs sous forme de nuées jumelles odoriférantes.
Douze tables sphériques encerclées par des sièges en soie
Arrivant au niveau de la poitrine d'un homme, soutenues
Sur des pattes de léopards, supportaient l'or pesant
Des coupes et des gobelets et la moisson tant de fois citée
De la corne de Cérès; puis, dans d'énormes cratères le vin
Jaillissait de la sombre amphore en joyeux rayonnement.
Ainsi chargées de victuailles, les tables se dressaient,
Chacune ayant enchâssée au centre l'image d'un Dieu.

Lorsque dans une antichambre chaque convive
[Pg 317]Eut senti l'éponge pleine de fraîcheur, pressée selon son plaisir
Par les esclaves qui les servaient, sur ses mains et ses pieds,
Et les huiles odorantes avec le cérémonial consacré
Versées sur sa chevelure, tous se dirigèrent vers le festin
En robes blanches, et se placèrent en ordre
Autour des couches soyeuses, se demandant avec étonnement
D'où pouvait venir ce fastueux ruissellement et ce torrent de richesses.

Douce soupira la musique dans la douce atmosphère
Tant que le Grec harmonieux au chant de voyelles
Domina parmi les invités, discourant tout bas
D'abord, car le vin commençait à peine à couler.
Mais lorsque le jus divin émut leurs cerveaux,
Plus haut ils parlèrent et plus haut sonnèrent les accords
Des puissants instruments:—les somptueuses colorations,
L'immensité du hall, la splendeur des draperies,
Le luxe imposant du plafond, l'ivresse du nectar,
La beauté des esclaves, celle de Lamia elle-même, apparurent.
Alors, quand le vin eut exercé son action rosée,
Et que chaque âme se fut libérée de toute entrave humaine,
Tout cessa de paraître étrange; le vin joyeux, le vin succulent,
[Pg 318]Ne rendra pas les ombres Elyséennes trop belles, ni trop divines.
En peu de temps le Dieu Bacchus fut à son apogée;
Cramoisies étaient les joues, et les yeux brillants brillaient doublement;
Des guirlandes de toutes les nuances et de toutes les senteurs,
Dépouilles des vallées; ou les branches, dîmes prélevées sur les arbres des forêts
En des corbeilles de luisant osier doré, étaient apportées
Aussi haut que montaient les anses, pour satisfaire
Les goûts de chaque convive, de façon que chacun comme il lui plaisait,
Put orner son front à sa fantaisie, mollement enfoncé dans les coussins.

Quelle couronne pour Lamia? Quelle pour Lycius?
Quelle pour le sage, le vieil Apollonius?
Sur le front douloureux de Lamia, que l'on pende
Des feuilles de saule et une langue de vipère;
Quant au jeune homme, vite, dépouillons pour lui
Le thyrse, pour que ses yeux enquêteurs puissent nager
Dans l'oubli; et, quant au philosophe,
Que le chiendent et le haineux chardon portent
La guerre sur ses tempes. Tous les charmes ne sont-ils pas rompus
Au simple contact de la froide philosophie?
Il y avait un arc-en-ciel que nous vénérions autrefois au firmament:
[Pg 319]Nous connaissons sa trame, sa contexture; elle est donnée
Platement dans le catalogue des choses communes.
La philosophie rognera les ailes de l'ange,
Conquerra les mystères à l'aide de règles et de lignes,
Videra l'atmosphère hanté, la mine qu'habitent les gnomes.—
Elle dépoétisera l'arc-en-ciel, comme jadis elle fit
Pour la tendre Lamia dissoute en une ombre.

A côté de celle-ci, Lycius, assis à la place d'honneur,
Dans toute la salle ne voyait pour ainsi dire qu'elle,
Jusqu'à ce que, réprimant son amoureuse extase, il prît une coupe
Remplie jusqu'aux bords, et, en face de lui, lançât un coup d'œil
A travers la large table pour implorer un regard
De son vieux maître qui fronçait le sourcil,
Et lui porter un toast. Le philosophe à la tête chauve
Avait fixé ses yeux, sans un clignement, sans un mouvement de paupières,
Droit sur le visage alarmé de la fiancée,
Décontenançant sa radieuse beauté et troublant sa douce fierté,
Tandis que son amant lui pressait la main, la caressant amoureusement,
Comme pâle elle reposait sur la couche rose:
Elle était glacée, et le froid courut à travers les veines de Lycius;
[Pg 320]Puis soudain elle devint brûlante, et toutes les fièvres
D'une chaleur surnaturelle lui montèrent au cœur.
—Lamia, que signifie ceci? pourquoi tressailles-tu?
Connais-tu cet homme?» La pauvre Lamia ne répondit pas.
Il darda ses yeux dans les siens, qui pas un instant
N'exaucèrent l'humble prière du triste amoureux;
Il les darda plus, plus encore; sa raison humaine chancelait:
Une sorte de charme dévorant absorbait cette grâce,
Ces orbes ne donnaient plus aucun signe de reconnaissance.
—Lamia!» gémit-il. Aucune tendre voix ne répondit.
La foule entendit, et la bruyante orgie instantanément
Se tut; les puissantes sonorités de la musique s'étouffèrent;
Les myrtes se desséchèrent dans les milles couronnes.
Par degrés, la voix, le luth et le plaisir cessèrent.
Un silence de mort peu à peu domina,
Jusqu'à ce qu'il semblât que quelque chose d'horrible fût survenu,
—Lamia!» hurlait-il d'une voix stridente, et seul ce cri strident
Suivi de son lamentable écho, rompait le silence,
—Va-t-en, rêve impur, gémissait-il fixant toujours
La figure de la fiancée; mais aucune veine azurée maintenant
Ne parcourait plus le contour parfait des tempes; aucune douce rougeur
[Pg 321]Ne colorait plus les joues; plus de passion pour éclairer
Cette vision profondément enfouie:—tout était flétri:
Lamia, sa beauté disparue, était assise mortellement blanche
—Ferme, ferme ces yeux trompeurs, toi, homme cruel!
Détourne les, misérable! ou l'arrêt sévère
De tous les dieux, dont les majestueux portraits
Représentent ici les invisibles présences,
Va les percer à l'instant avec l'épine
D'une douloureuse cécité, te laissant désolé,
Tremblant et radotant devant la plus faible crainte
De conscience, parce que tu as longtemps offensé leur puissance
Par tous tes sophismes impies et orgueilleux,
Tes sortilèges illicites et tes séduisants mensonges.
Corinthiens! examinez ce misérable à la barbe grise,
Constatez que, comme un possédé, ses paupières sans cils s'ouvrent
Autour de ses yeux de démon! Regardez-le, Corinthiens!
Mon aimable fiancée se fane sous leur influence.»
—Fou!» dit le sophiste, à demi-voix
D'un ton brusque et méprisant. Ce fut par une plainte d'agonisant
Que Lycius répondit, comme, frappé au cœur, éperdu,
Il s'assit sans force auprès du douloureux fantôme.
—Fou! Fou!» répétait Apollonius, les yeux toujours
Implacables et fixes:—De tout mal
[Pg 322]De la vie je t'ai préservé jusqu'à ce jour,
Faut-il te voir maintenant la proie d'un serpent?»
A ce moment Lamia exhala un soupir de mourante; le regard du sophiste
Telle une lance affilée, la traversa de part en part,
Aigu, cruel, acéré, pénétrant: elle, autant
Que sa main débile pouvait exprimer une intention,
Le supplia de se taire; mais vainement!
Il regarda encore et encore fixement—Non!
—Un serpent!» reprit-il en écho. Il n'eut pas plus tôt dit,
Que, poussant un effroyable cri, elle disparut:
Et les bras de Lycius furent vidés[1] de leur bonheur
Comme ses membres de leur vie, à partir de cette même nuit.
Sur la haute couche il est étendu!—ses amis l'entourèrent—
Le soulevèrent—ils ne trouvèrent ni pulsation, ni respiration,
Mais, dans sa robe de noce, le pesant cadavre avec sa blessure.

Septembre 1819.

[Pg 323]

HYPÉRION[1]
FRAGMENT
LIVRE PREMIER
Tout au fond de la tristesse d'une obscure vallée[2],
Dans une retraite éloignée de la brise vivifiante du matin,
Loin de l'ardent midi et de l'étoile solitaire du soir,
Etait assis Saturne aux cheveux gris, immobile comme un roc,
Aussi muet que le silence planant autour de son repaire;
Forêts sur forêts s'inclinaient autour de sa tête
Comme nuées sur nuées. Aucun souffle dans l'air,
Pas même autant de vie qu'il n'en faut un jour d'été,

[Pg 324]Pour faire envoler de l'herbe effilée la graine la plus légère;
Où la feuille morte tombait, là elle demeurait.
Un ruisseau coulait à côté sans voix, dont le susurrement était encore assourdi
Par respect pour la divinité déchue
Qui projetait une ombre sur lui: une Naïade parmi ses roseaux
Pressait son doigt humide appuyé sur ses lèvres.

Le long du sable de la rive, de larges empreintes étaient marquées,
Aussi loin que les pieds du dieu avaient marché,
Puis s'étaient fixés là. Sur le sol détrempé
Sa main droite ridée reposait inerte, nonchalante, morte,
Privée de son sceptre; et ses yeux de souverain détrôné étaient clos;
Tandis que sa tête penchée semblait écouter la terre
Son antique mère, attendant d'elle quelque consolation encore.

Il semblait qu'aucune force ne pût le faire mouvoir de sa place;
Cependant vint là quelqu'un, qui d'une main familière
Toucha ses vastes épaules, après s'être courbé très bas
Avec déférence, quoique ce fut pour quelqu'un qui ne la connaissait plus.
C'était une déesse du monde à son enfance;
[Pg 325]Auprès d'elle la stature de l'énorme Amazone
Aurait paru de la taille d'un pygmée: elle eût saisi
Achille par la chevelure et lui eût ployé le cou,
Ou, d'un doigt, eût arrêté la roue d'Ixion.
Sa face était grande comme celle du Sphinx de Memphis,
Hissée sur quelque piédestal dans la cour d'un palais,
Lorsque les sages étudiaient l'Egypte pour s'instruire.
Mais, oh! comme cette figure différait du marbre!
Quelle beauté! si la tristesse n'avait pas rendu
La tristesse plus belle que la Beauté elle-même!
Il y avait dans son regard une crainte aux aguets,
Comme si le malheur venait seulement de la frapper;
Comme si les nuages, avant-gardes des jours néfastes,
Avaient épuisé leurs maléfices et les arrière-gardes acharnées
Allaient amasser péniblement leurs provisions de tonnerres.
D'une main elle pressait le point douloureux
Où bat le cœur humain, comme si juste là
Quoique immortelle, elle ressentait une cruelle souffrance:
L'autre main sur le cou penché de Saturne
Etait appuyée, et au niveau de son oreille
Tendant ses lèvres ouvertes, elle proféra quelques mots
D'un ton solennel, avec la sonorité profonde de l'orgue:
Quelques mots désespérés qui dans notre faible langue
Se traduiraient à peu près en ces termes—O combien frêles
[Pg 326]En comparaison de la puissante voix des Dieux primitifs!—
«Saturne, relève la tête! Cependant pourquoi, pauvre vieux Roi?
Car je n'ai pas de consolation pour toi, non, je n'en ai pas:
Je ne peux pas dire: Oh pourquoi dors-tu?
Puisque le ciel s'est séparé de toi, et que la terre
Ne te reconnaît plus, dans cette affliction, pour un Dieu:
L'Océan, aussi, avec son bruit solennel,
A rejeté ton sceptre, et toute l'atmosphère
Est vide de ta majesté surannée.
Ta foudre, sachant qui commande maintenant,
Gronde contrainte au-dessus de notre demeure en ruine,
Et ton éclair éblouissant entre des mains inexpérimentées
Dévaste et brûle notre domaine autrefois paisible.
O douloureuse époque! O minutes longues comme des années!
Tout, pendant que vous passez, accroît la monstrueuse vérité,
Et comprime tellement nos horribles angoisses
Que l'incrédulité n'a plus de champ pour respirer.
Saturne, continue à dormir—Oh! pourquoi, étourdiment ai-je ainsi
Violé ton sommeil solitaire?
Pourquoi ai-je rouvert tes yeux mélancoliques?
Saturne, continue à dormir! tandis qu'à tes pieds je pleure!»
[Pg 327]De même que, dans l'extase d'une nuit d'été,
Ces sénateurs des bois puissants dans leur verte parure,
Les chênes élevés, aux branches enchantées par l'ardeur des étoiles,
Rêvent, et rêvent ainsi toute la nuit sans autre frémissement
Que celui de la brise qui s'enfle graduellement dans la solitude,
Domine le silence, puis s'évanouit,
Comme une marée montante qui n'aurait qu'une vague;
De même ces paroles retentirent, puis expirèrent; un instant, en larmes,
Elle toucha la terre de son front hautain et loyal,
De façon que sa chevelure tombante pût étaler un tapis
Soyeux et merveilleux pour les pieds de Saturne.
La lune, en une lente gravitation, avait versé
Ses lueurs argentées quatre heures à travers la nuit,
Et toujours le groupe était demeuré immobile
Telle une sculpture naturelle dans la crypte d'une cathédrale:
Le Dieu glacé reposant toujours sur la terre,
Et la triste Déesse pleurant à ses pieds;
Jusqu'à ce qu'enfin le vieux Saturne leva
Ses yeux flétris, et vit son royaume détruit,
L'aspect sombre et morne du lieu,
Et cette belle Déesse agenouillée; alors il parla,
Comme avec une langue paralysée, tandis que sa barbe
Hérissée s'agitait d'un tremblement maladif:
«O tendre épouse du brillant Hypérion,
[Pg 328]Théa, je te devine plutôt que je ne vois ta face;
Lève les yeux pour que j'y lise notre condamnation:
Lève les yeux et dis-moi si cette forme fragile
Est bien celle de Saturne; dis-moi si tu reconnais
La voix de Saturne; dis-moi si ce front ridé,
Nu et dépouillé de son haut diadème
Ressemble bien à celui de Saturne? Qui eut la puissance
De me plonger en cette détresse? d'où vint cette force?
Comment fut-elle préparée pour éclater tout-à-coup
Pendant que le Destin semblait emprisonné dans ma nerveuse étreinte?
Mais c'est ainsi; me voilà anéanti,
Rejeté dans l'ombre, n'exerçant plus aucun pouvoir divin
Ni aucune influence favorable sur les pâles planètes,
Ni de contrôle sur les vents et sur les mers,
Ni d'action bienfaisante sur les moissons des hommes,
Et privé de faire tout ce qu'une Déité suprême
Accomplit pour soulager la tendresse de son cœur. Je suis chassé
De ma propre poitrine; j'ai abandonné
Ma forte identité, mon moi véritable,
Quelque part entre le trône et le lieu où je suis assis,
Là à cet endroit de la terre. Cherche, Théa, cherche!
Ouvre tes yeux immortels, qu'ils embrassent
Tous les espaces: l'espace étoilé et celui qui est sans lumière,
[Pg 329]L'espace qui contient l'air vivifiant et celui qui en est dépourvu;
Les espaces de feu et tous les gouffres de l'enfer.
Cherche, Théa, Cherche! et dis-moi si tu discernes
Quelque forme ou quelque ombre, arrivant
Impétueusement, avec des ailes ou sur un char, pour reprendre possession
Du ciel perdu naguère: cela doit être,—c'est
A maturité[3]—Saturne doit être Roi.
Oui, il faut qu'il ait une victoire resplendissante comme l'or,
Il faut qu'il y ait des Dieux renversés et des éclats de trompette
Dans un calme triomphe, et des hymnes de fête
Sur les nuages dorés de l'Olympe,
Des voix sereines qui proclament la victoire, et des cordes d'argent
Qui résonnent dans de creuses écailles; et il y aura
De belles choses renouvelées, pour l'étonnement
Des enfants du ciel. C'est moi qui ordonnerai;
Théa! Théa! Théa! Où est Saturne?»

Dans son délire, il se remit sur pied,
Et ses mains s'agitaient dans l'air au-dessus de sa tête,
Ses boucles druidiques[4] étaient secouées et trempées de sueur,
[Pg 330]Ses yeux reflétaient la fièvre, sa voix s'éteignit.
Toujours debout, il n'entendait pas les profonds sanglots de Théa;
Après un intervalle, il recommença à jeter
Ces exclamations: «Ne puis-je pas créer?
Ne puis-je pas former? Ne puis-je pas façonner subitement
Un autre monde, un autre univers
Pour écraser et réduire en poussière celui-ci?
Où y a-t-il un autre chaos? Où?» Ce mot
Retentit jusque dans l'Olympe et fit frémir
Les trois rebelles?[5] Théa avait tressailli,
Et dans son attitude perçait une sorte d'espoir,
A mesure que ses phrases se précipitaient, pourtant pleines de respect:

«Ceci mène à notre demeure détruite: viens vers nos amis,
O Saturne! viens, et donne leur du courage;
Je connais leur retraite, je l'ai quittée pour te trouver ici.»
Elle n'en dit pas plus long: puis le suppliant du regard, elle marcha
A reculons à travers l'obscurité pendant un instant.
Il suivit, et elle se retourna pour le guider
A travers les branches vermoulues, qui cédaient comme la brume
[Pg 331]Que traverse l'aigle lorsqu'il s'élance au-dessus de son nid.

Pendant ce temps, dans d'autres royaumes de nombreuses larmes étaient répandues,
Une affliction semblable à celle-ci, une souffrance semblable
Trop profonde pour être exprimée par la voix ou la plume d'un mortel:
Les farouches Titans, soit dans leurs cachettes, soit dans les prisons,
Gémissaient une fois de plus sur leur vieille fidélité,
Et, dans une douloureuse angoisse écoutaient la voix de Saturne,
Cependant, de toute cette lignée de géants, un seul conservait encore
Sa souveraineté, son autorité et sa majesté;
Hypérion, resplendissant au milieu de son orbe de feu
Etait encore sur son trône, respirait encore l'encens, l'envoyant
De l'homme jusqu'au Dieu du soleil; inquiet cependant:
Car de même, que parmi nous, humains, les tristes présages
Effraient et épouvantent, lui, de même frissonnait—
Non à cause du hurlement d'un chien, ou du nid détesté de l'oiseau de nuit,
Ou de la visite familière de quelqu'un
Au premier tintement de son glas funèbre,
[Pg 332]Ou des prophéties de la lampe à minuit;
Mais des horreurs proportionnées à ses nerfs de géant
Le torturaient souvent. Son rutilant palais
Bastionné de pyramides d'un or étincelant,
Et que touchait l'ombre des obélisques de bronze,
Lançait des lueurs rouge sang à travers ses mille cours,
Ses voûtes, ses dômes, et ses galeries embrasées;
Et toutes ces tentures tissées avec les nuages de l'Aurore
Rougeoyaient furieusement: tandis que parfois des ailes d'aigles
Que n'avaient jamais vus ni les dieux ni les hommes étonnés:
L'assombrissaient; et des hennissements de chevaux étaient entendus.
Que n'avaient jamais entendus ni les Dieux ni les hommes étonnés.
De plus lorsqu'il voulait humer les tourbillons aromatisés
De l'encens, s'envolant dans l'éther du haut de la colline sacrée,
Au lieu d'odeurs agréables, son énorme palais ne percevait
Que le goût empoisonné du cuivre ou d'un métal corrompu:
De même, lorsque réfugié dans le sommeil à l'Occident,
Après le plein achèvement d'une belle journée,—
Pour gagner son divin repos sur une couche céleste
Et sommeiller dans les bras de la mélodie,
[Pg 333]Il dépensait les heures plaisantes du délassement
A passer de salles en salles en colossales enjambées;
Tandis qu'au loin dans chaque nef latérale et dans les chambres profondes,
Ses favoris ailés se tenaient en groupes serrés
Attentifs et remplis de crainte, tels des gens inquiets
Qui se rassemblent en troupes terrifiées, par les vastes plaines,
Lorsque les tremblements de terre ébranlent leurs remparts et leurs tours.
En ce moment même, pendant que Saturne, sorti de sa glaciale léthargie,
Marchait sur les traces de Théa à travers les bois,
Hypérion laissant le crépuscule derrière lui
Redescendait sur le seuil de l'Ouest.
Alors, ainsi que d'habitude, la porte du palais s'ouvrit
Au milieu du silence le plus absolu, où seuls les solennels tubas,
Dans lesquels souillaient gravement les zéphyrs, exhalèrent de suaves
Et ailées sonorités, des mélodies au rythme lent:
Et semblable à une rose, pour la couleur vermeille et la forme,
Pour la finesse du parfum, et la fraîcheur qu'elle montrait,
Cette entrée conduisant à une sévère magnificence
Demeura largement ouverte pour que le Dieu y pénétrât.
[Pg 334]Il entra, mais il entra plein de courroux;
Sa robe de flammes traînant loin derrière ses talons
Faisait entendre un sifflement, comme d'un feu terrestre,
Qui effarouchait les douces heures éthérées,
Et faisait trembler les ailes des colombes. En avant il flamboyait
Majestueusement de nef en nef, de voûte en voûte,
A travers le scintillement des salles odorantes et enguirlandées
Et les longues arcades pavées de diamants éblouissants,
Jusqu'à ce qu'il gagnât la grande coupole principale;
Là s'arrêtant, debout, farouche, il frappa du pied,
Et depuis les profondeurs des fondations jusqu'au faîte des tours
Il ébranla sa demeure d'or massif; puis avant
Que le roulement du tonnerre eût cessé dans les cintres,
Sa voix retentit, en dépit de la retenue que se doit un dieu,
Pour clamer: «O rêves du jour et de la nuit!
O formes monstrueuses! O faces de douleur!
O spectres s'agitant dans une froide, froide obscurité!
O fantômes aux longues oreilles, hôtes des étangs aux herbes sombres!
Pourquoi vous ai-je connus? pourquoi vous ai-je vus? pourquoi
Mon éternelle essence est-elle ainsi harcelée
Par la vue et le spectacle de ces nouvelles horreurs?
Saturne est vaincu, dois-je aussi l'être?
[Pg 335]Dois-je quitter cet asile de mon repos,
Ce berceau de ma gloire, ce doux séjour,
Cette paisible abondance de lumière bienheureuse,
Ces pavillons de cristal, ces temples purifiés,
Qui forment mon radieux empire? Tout est
Déserté, abandonné, tout ce qui fut ma retraite.
Eclat, splendeur, symétrie! Où êtes-vous?
Je ne distingue que ténèbres, mort et ténèbres.
Même ici, au centre de mon refuge,
Les visions spectrales viennent me tyranniser,
Pour insulter, aveugler, étouffer mon faste.
Tomber!—Non, par Tellus et sa parure d'ondes salées!
Par delà les frontières de flamme qui bornent mes royaumes
J'avancerai et de ma redoutable droite
Je terrifierai cet enfant maître du tonnerre, ce Jupiter rebelle,
Et je demanderai au vieux Saturne de reprendre possession de son trône.»
Il dit, puis se tut, tandis qu'une menace plus formidable
Luttait pour sortir de sa gorge, sans y parvenir;
Ainsi, lorsque les hommes sont en foule dans les théâtres,
Le brouhaha augmente plus ils crient: «Hush»
De même aux paroles d'Hypérion, les livides fantômes
S'enfuirent, trois fois horribles et glacés:
Et du lieu, uni comme un miroir, où il parlait
S'éleva un brouillard, comme d'un lac couvert d'écume.
[Pg 336]Alors, à travers tout son corps, une agonie
Se glissa peu à peu, des pieds jusqu'à sa couronne,
Avec la souplesse d'un serpent puissant et musculeux
Rampant lentement, la tête et le cou convulsés
Par suite d'un trop violent effort. Revenu à lui, il vola
Vers les confins de l'Orient, et pendant six heures brumeuses
Avant que l'aube, à l'heure habituelle, rougît l'horizon,
Il projeta son souffle impétueux contre les portes du sommeil
Les dégagea des lourdes nuées, et les fit éclater tumultueusement
Tout à coup sur les flots gelés de l'Océan.
L'astre de feu, sur lequel il parcourait
Chaque jour de l'Est à l'Ouest les espaces du ciel,
Décrivait une circonférence dans un sombre rideau de nuages;
Il n'était donc pas tout à fait voilé, ni éclipsé, ni caché,
Mais de temps en temps les sphères étincelantes,
Les cercles, et les arcs, et les vastes ceintures des colures,
Brillaient au travers et dessinaient sur ce manteau opaque
Des éclairs aux formes délicates, depuis les profondeurs du nadir
Jusqu'au zénith—hiéroglyphes antiques,
Que les sages et les astrologues aux yeux exercés
Alors habitant la terre, à l'aide de laborieux calculs
[Pg 337]Déchiffraient grâce aux observations de nombreux siècles:
Ils sont perdus maintenant, excepté ceux que nous trouvons sur les énormes blocs
De pierre ou de marbre noir; leur signification oubliée,
Leur sagesse, a depuis longtemps disparu. Deux ailes cet orbe
Possédait comme ornement, deux resplendissantes ailes en argent,
Toujours étendues à l'approche du Dieu.
Et maintenant, émergeant de l'obscurité, leurs plumes immenses
S'élevaient une à une, jusqu'à ce qu'elles fussent toutes déployées;
Tandis que le globe éblouissant demeurait éclipsé,
Attendant l'ordre d'Hypérion.
Volontiers eût-il donné l'ordre, volontiers eût-il repris son trône
Et commandé au jour d'apparaître, si ce n'eût été que pour un changement[6].
Il n'en eut pas la force: Non, quoique Dieu des premiers âges,
Il ne devait pas troubler les saisons sacrées.
Donc les différentes périodes de l'aube
Restèrent dans leur première phase, juste comme il est dit ici.
[Pg 338]Ces deux ailes d'argent s'éployèrent semblables à deux sœurs
Impatientes de faire voguer leur sphère; les vastes portes
Furent ouvertes sur l'obscur domaine de la nuit;
Et le Titan du soleil, exaspéré par ce nouveau désastre,
Inaccoutumé à plier, sous une dure contrainte plia
Son esprit à la tristesse du temps;
Et le long d'une lugubre traînée de nuages
Sur les limites du jour et de la nuit
Il s'étendit, pleurant la défaillance de sa splendeur.
Comme il gisait ainsi prostré, les cieux avec leurs étoiles
Jetèrent sur lui des yeux pitoyables, et la voix
De Cœlus, du haut de l'espace universel,
Murmura tout bas ces solennelles paroles à son oreille:
«O le plus brillant de mes enfants chéris, né sur la terre,
Engendré dans le ciel, Fils des Mystères
Dont aucun n'a été révélé même aux puissances
Qui se concertèrent pour ta création: leurs joies,
Leurs douces palpitations et leurs célestes plaisirs;
Moi, Cœlus, je m'en étonne: comment vinrent-ils et d'où?
Et quelles sont d'après leurs fruits leurs formes
Distinctes et visibles; symboles divins,
Manifestations de cette admirable vie
Eparses et indiscernables à travers l'éternel espace?
C'est d'eux que tu fus créé à nouveau, o très brillant enfant!
[Pg 339]C'est d'eux que la reçurent tes frères et les Déesses!
Il existe parmi vous une grave dissension, une révolte
Du fils contre son père. J'ai vu vaincu,
J'ai vu précipité de son trône mon premier né!
Vers moi ses bras étaient tendus, c'est moi que sa voix
Implora à travers le tonnerre qui menaçait sa tête!
J'étais livide et je me cachais la face dans les nuées.
Dois-tu, toi aussi, subir le même traitement? j'en ai un vague pressentiment:
Car j'ai vu mes fils bien peu semblables à des dieux.
Divins vous avez été créés, et divins
Dans un grave maintien, majestueux, sereins,
Calmes, comme de hauts Dieux, vous avez vécu et gouverné:
Maintenant je remarque en vous crainte, espoir et colère,
Des actes de rage et de passion; exactement comme
Je les vois dans le monde des mortels, vos sujets,
Chez ceux qui succombent. Voilà ma tristesse, o mon fils!
Lugubre signe de ruine, de soudaine épouvante et de défaite!
Cependant, toi, résiste; car tu en es capable,
Car tu peux te mouvoir, étant un véritable Dieu;
Tu peux opposer à chaque heure mauvaise
Ta présence éthérée: moi, je ne suis qu'une voix;
Ma vie n'est que la vie des vents et des marées,
Pas plus que vents et marées je ne puis être un secours;
Mais toi tu le peux. Mets-toi dans le van
[Pg 340]De la circonstance; oui, saisis la pointe de la flèche
Avant que la corde tendue ne résonne—Va vers la terre!
Là tu trouveras Saturne et ses douleurs.
Pendant ce temps je veillerai sur l'éclat du soleil
Et serai le gardien vigilant de tes saisons».
Avant que ce chuchotement fut à moitié émis,
Hypérion se redressa, et sur les étoiles
Leva ses paupières recourbées, puis les tint grandes ouvertes
Jusqu'à ce que la voix s'éteignît; et toujours il les tenait ouvertes:
Et toujours c'étaient les mêmes brillantes et patientes étoiles.
Alors inclinant lentement sa large poitrine,
Tel un plongeur dans les mers riches en perles,
En avant, il se baissa sur le rivage aérien,
Et s'enfonça, sans bruit dans la profonde nuit.

[2] Dans sa brève étude, le traducteur a signalé les rappels de phrases et de mots dont Keats a tiré un merveilleux parti. Cependant, dans plusieurs pièces inachevées, et particulièrement dans Hypérion, le poète a laissé subsister quelques répétitions fortuites et non calculées qu'il eût peut-être supprimées si la mort ne l'avait empêché de réviser son œuvre. Est-il besoin d'ajouter que le texte critique de l'auteur a été scrupuleusement respecté?

[3] Of Ripe progress: d'exécution mûrie.

[4] Deux fois dans Hypérion Keats a commis cet étrange anachronisme.

LIVRE II
En ce moment, au battement même des larges ailes du Temps
Hypérion glissa par les airs bruissants,
Et Saturne gagna avec Théa la triste place
Où Cybèle et les Titans meurtris se lamentaient.
[Pg 341]C'était une caverne dans laquelle aucune lumière ne pouvait
En les éclairant insulter à leurs larmes; où de leurs propres gémissements
Ils avaient la sensation sans les entendre, car le puissant rugissement
Des tonnantes cascades et des rauques torrents
Précipitait sans relâche une cataracte d'eau, on ne sait où.
Des rocs se projetant pêle-mêle sur des rocs, et des récifs qui semblaient
Chaque instant s'éveiller d'un songe,
Front contre front, dressaient leurs monstrueuses cornes;
Ainsi, en des milliers de fantaisies démesurées,
Ils formaient un toit qui convenait à ce refuge de vaincus.
Comme trônes, ils avaient des cailloux rugueux,
Comme couches, des pierres raboteuses, et des arêtes d'ardoises
Dures comme du fer. Tous n'étaient pas réunis là.
Les uns étaient enchaînés dans la torture, d'autres étaient en fuite.
Cœcus, et Gygès et Briarée,
Typhon et Dolor et Porphyrion,
Ainsi que beaucoup d'autres, les plus acharnés dans l'assaut,
Etaient parqués dans des régions où l'on respire difficilement:
[Pg 342]Emprisonnés dans un élément opaque, de façon à contraindre
Les dents serrées à rester toujours serrées, et tous leurs membres
Encerclés comme des faisceaux de métal, tenaillés et vissés;
Sans autre mouvement que la palpitation de leurs grands cœurs
Haletants dans la douleur, horriblement convulsés
Par la fièvre de leur sang en ébullition et les secousses de leurs pouls.
Mnémosyne menait par le monde une course vagabonde;
Séparée de son astre, Phœbé était la proie des hasards;
Beaucoup d'autres erraient librement à l'aventure,
Mais la plupart trouvaient là un abri désolé.
De vagues images de vie, de ci de là
Gisaient, masses aux saillantes arêtes: tel un cercle morne
De pierres druidiques, sur une lande déserte
Lorsque la froide pluie commence à la tombée du jour
Dans le triste novembre, alors que leur sanctuaire voûté.
Le firmament lui-même, est obscurci par la nuit.
Chacun se tenait sur la réserve, aucun ne se signalait à son voisin
Par un mot, ou un regard, ou un geste désespéré.
Créus en était un; sa pesante massue de fer
A côté de lui, et un débris de roc fracassé
Témoignait de sa rage, avant d'être abattu et caché,
Iäpetus un autre, étreignait
[Pg 343]Le cou fangeux d'un serpent, dont la langue acérée
Pendait hors de la gorge; les anneaux s'étaient déroulés
Dans la mort; c'était pour le punir de n'avoir pu darder
Son poison dans les yeux de Jupiter vainqueur.
Contre lui, Cottus; tout de son long étalé, le menton soulevé en avant.
Comme plongé dans la douleur, sans relâche sur le gravier
Il s'écorchait cruellement le crâne, la bouche ouverte
Et les yeux dilatés par cet horrible travail. Plus près de lui
Asia, née de la gigantesque montagne de Caf,
Qui coûta à sa mère Tellus des angoisses plus cruelles,
Quoiqu'elle fût femme, qu'aucun de ses fils.
Il y avait plus de pensée que de tristesse dans sa face ambrée,
Parce qu'elle prévoyait sa propre gloire;
Et que dans sa vaste imagination se dressaient
Des temples à l'ombre des palmiers et de hauts sanctuaires rivaux,
Sur les rives de l'Oxus ou dans les îles sacrées du Gange.
De même que l'Espérance s'appuie sur son ancre,
De même s'appuyait-elle, moins belle, sur une défense
Enlevée au plus grand de ses éléphants.
Au-dessus d'elle, sur le flanc inhospitalier d'une roche,
Dressé sur son coude, le reste du corps étendu,
Etait abrité Encelade, autrefois pacifique et paisible
Comme un bœuf paissant en liberté dans les prairies;
[Pg 344]Maintenant tigre par la passion, lion par la pensée, furieux,
Il méditait, complotait; pour le moment
Il lançait des montagnes, dans cette seconde lutte
Qui ne tarderait pas, et réduirait les jeunes Dieux terrorisés
A se cacher dans des corps d'animaux et d'oiseaux.
Non loin de là, Atlas; et couché à ses côtés
Phorcus, le chef des Gorgones. Son proche voisin
Etait Océanus, et Thétys dans le sein de laquelle
Sanglotait Clymène les cheveux embroussaillés.
Au centre reposait Thémis, aux pieds
D'Ops, la reine invisible tant les nuages l'enveloppaient.
Aucune forme ne se précisait, pas plus que lorsque
La nuit épaisse confond les sommets des pins avec les nuées:
Enfin beaucoup d'autres dont les noms ne peuvent être cités.
Car lorsque les ailes de la Muse sont déployées dans l'espace,
Qui arrêtera son vol? Et elle doit chanter
Sur Saturne, et son guide qui a maintenant escaladé
Les pieds glissant dans l'humidité, surgissant des abîmes
Plus affreux encore. Au-dessus d'une sombre falaise
Leurs têtes apparurent et leur taille croissait
Jusqu'à ce qu'étant de niveau avec le sol, ils pussent marcher à l'aise:
Alors Théa étendit au loin ses bras frémissants
Au-dessus des frontières de ce séjour de douleur,
[Pg 345]Et furtivement fixa ses regards sur la figure de Saturne.
Elle y lut le plus cruel combat; le Dieu souverain
Se débattant contre l'affaissement du chagrin,
De la rage, de la crainte, de l'anxiété, de la revanche,
Du remords, du dégoût, de l'espoir, et par-dessus tout du désespoir.
Contre ces détresses il luttait en vain; puisque le Destin
Avait répandu sur sa tête l'huile mortelle,
Le poison dissolvant: de sorte que Théa
Effrayée, se tint coite, et le laissa pénétrer
Le premier, au milieu de la tribu déchue.

De même que, chez nous mortels, le cœur oppressé
Est plus harcelé encore et plus fiévreux,
Lorsqu'il approche de la maison de deuil
Où d'autres cœurs souffrent des mêmes affres;
De même Saturne, comme il avançait au centre
Se sentit défaillir, et serait tombé au milieu de tous,
S'il n'avait rencontré les yeux d'Encelade,
Dont la grandeur d'âme, dont la vénération pour lui, tout d'un coup
Le frappèrent comme une inspiration; et il s'écria—
«Titans, regardez votre Dieu.» A ces paroles, quelques uns gémirent;
Quelques uns se dressèrent sur leurs pieds, d'autres aussi crièrent;
Les uns pleuraient, les autres se lamentaient, tous se prosternaient avec respect;
Alors Ops, relevant son voile aux plis noirs,
[Pg 346]Découvrit ses joues pâles et son front blême,
Ses sourcils maigres et hérissés, et ses yeux caves.
Un grondement surgit parmi les pins qui ont poussé sous le vent glacé
Lorsque l'Hiver élève la voix; un vacarme surgit
Parmi les immortels lorsqu'un Dieu fait du doigt un geste
Qui impose le silence, et exprime combien est chargée
Sa langue de tout le poids de pensées inexprimables:
La foudre, la musique et la majesté:
C'est un ronflement semblable à celui de pins qui ont poussé sous le vent glacé;
Quand il cesse dans les montagnes de ce monde,
On n'entend aucun autre bruit; mais lorsqu'il cessa ici
Parmi ces déchus, la voix de Saturne dans ce silence
S'enfla comme un orgue, qui recommence
A tonner, quand les autres harmonies, arrêtées net,
Laissent dans l'air, étouffées, leurs vibrations argentines.
Il éclata en ces termes «Ce n'est pas dans mon propre cœur brisé,
Qui est à lui-même son juge suprême et son enquêteur,
Que je peux trouver des raisons pour que vous soyiez ainsi:
Ce n'est pas dans les légendes du tout premier jour
Recueillies dans ce livre aux feuillets imprégnés de l'esprit antique,
Que l'étincelant Uranus de son doigt glorieux
Sauva des rivages ténébreux, lorsque les vagues
[Pg 347]Même pendant les reflux le cachaient dans les sombres bas fonds;
Vous savez que ce livre, je l'ai toujours pris
Comme un solide point d'appui:—Ah, malheureux!
Ni ici, ni en signe, en symbole, en présage
D'éléments, terre, eau, air et feu,—
En guerre, en paix, ou se querellant
Un contre un, contre deux, contre trois, ou chacun d'eux tous
En particulier contre les trois autres;
Ainsi le feu lutte contre l'air dans un orage, les torrents de pluie
Noient l'un et l'autre, et les poussent contre la surface de la terre,
Où ils rencontrent le soufre, en sorte qu'une quadruple fureur
Bouleverse le pauvre univers;—ce n'est pas dans ce conflit,
D'où je tire d'étranges leçons, en l'étudiant attentivement,
Que je peux trouver des raisons pour que vous en soyiez réduits là:
Non, rien ne peut expliquer, quelles que soient mes recherches,
Et mes investigations poursuivies sur le développement universel de la Nature
Jusqu'à en être épuisé, pourquoi vous, Divinités,
Les premiers nées parmi les Dieux visibles et palpables,
[Pg 348]Vous fléchiriez devant une puissance, qui, en comparaison
Ne doit pas vous faire trembler. Cependant, vous en êtes là!
Abattus, méprisés, écrasés, voilà ce que vous êtes!
O Titans, vous dirai-je «Levez-vous?»—Vous gémissez.
Vous dirai-je «Rampez.»—Vous gémissez. Que puis-je alors?
O vaste Ciel! O cher parent que je ne vois pas!
Que puis-je? Dites-moi, vous tous, Dieux, mes frères,
Comment pouvons-nous combattre, comment assouvir notre grande colère!
O donnez-nous un conseil maintenant, l'oreille de Saturne
Est avide de l'entendre. Toi, Océanus,
Tes pensées sont hautes et profondes; et sur ta face
Je lis, étonné, ce sévère contentement
Qui naît de la réflexion et de la pensée: viens à notre aide!»

Ainsi termina Saturne, et le Dieu de la Mer
Sophiste et sage, non qu'il eût fréquenté les bosquets d'Athènes,
Mais parce qu'il avait médité sous l'ombre de ses eaux,
Se leva. Ses cheveux n'étaient plus humides. Il débuta
D'une voix murmurante; sa langue à son premier essai
Etait comme celle d'un enfant, embarrassée, de plus, par l'écume des sables.
[Pg 349]«O vous, que la rage consume! que la passion aiguillonne,
Que la défaite torture, et qui vous repaissez de vos agonies!
Calmez vos sens, bouchez vos oreilles,
Ma voix n'est pas un rugissement vers la colère.
Cependant, écoutez, vous qui le voulez, pendant que j'apporte la preuve
Que vous devez, de force, vous contenter de vous soumettre.
A cette preuve, d'ailleurs, j'ajouterai une immense consolation,
Si vous consentez à accepter cette consolation comme véritable.
Nous sommes vaincus par les lois de la nature, non par la force
Du tonnerre ou de Jupiter. Grand Saturne, tu
As bien analysé les atomes de l'univers;
Mais, pour cette raison, que tu es le Roi,
Et aveuglé par l'autorité suprême,
Une route était cachée à tes yeux,
Par laquelle je suis parvenu à l'éternelle vérité.
En premier lieu, de même que tu ne fus pas le premier souverain,
De même tu n'es pas le dernier; cela ne peut être:
Tu n'es ni le commencement ni la fin.
Du chaos et des ténèbres, ses sœurs, naquit
La lumière, le premier fruit de ces brouilles intestines,
Ce ferment infectieux, qui pour des fins sublimes
[Pg 350]Mûrissait intérieurement. L'heure de la maturité arriva,
Et avec elle la lumière, et la lumière, s'engendrant
En se produisant elle-même, spontanément transforma
L'énorme ensemble de la matière pour lui insuffler la vie.
C'est à cette heure précisément que notre parenté,
Les Cieux et la Terre, devint manifeste:
A cette phase, toi le premier né, et nous la race géante,
Nous nous trouvâmes à la tête d'empires nouveaux et magnifiques.
Maintenant, voilà la vérité pénible à ceux pour lesquels elle est pénible;
O folie! car de supporter les vérités sans voiles,
Et d'envisager les circonstances, en gardant son sang-froid,
N'est-ce pas le summum de la toute puissance. Notez le bien!
De même que le Ciel et la Terre sont plus beaux, beaucoup plus beaux
Que le Chaos et les Ténèbres vides, quoique rois autrefois;
Et de même que nous montrons supérieurs à eux, le Ciel et la Terre,
Par la forme, la cohésion et la beauté,
Par la volonté, la liberté, la fraternité,
Et par des milliers d'autres signes d'une vie plus pure;
De même sur nos talons marche une perfection nouvelle,
Un pouvoir d'une beauté plus mâle, né de nous
Et destiné à nous surpasser, autant que nous surpassons
[Pg 351]En gloire les antiques Ténèbres: et nous ne sommes pas
Plus vaincus par eux que ne l'a été par nous la domination
Du Chaos sans forme. Dites-le? Le sol stupide
Se querelle-t-il avec les majestueuses forêts qu'il a nourries,
Et les nourrit-il plus volontiers que lui-même?
Peut-on lui dénier la souveraineté des verts bocages?
Ou les arbres porteront-ils envie aux colombes
Parce qu'elles roucoulent, et qu'elles ont des ailes de neige
Pour voler de ci de là et y trouver leurs joies?
Nous sommes tels que les arbres des forêts et nos vigoureuses branches
Ont nourri jadis, non de blanches colombes solitaires,
Mais des aigles aux plumes dorées qui planent
Au-dessus de nous dans leur beauté, et régneront
A cause de cela, en toute justice; car c'est une loi éternelle
Que celui qui l'emporte en beauté doit l'emporter en puissance:
Oui, au nom de cette loi, une autre race contraindra
Nos vainqueurs à gémir comme nous le faisons maintenant.
Avez-vous contemplé le jeune Dieu des Mers,
Celui qui me dépossède? Avez-vous vu sa figure!
Avez-vous regardé son char, couvert de l'écume
Des nobles êtres munis de nageoires qu'il a créés?
Je l'ai vu parcourir les flots calmes,
[Pg 352]Avec un tel rayonnement de beauté dans les yeux
Que cela me força de dire un triste adieu
A mon empire: de tristes adieux je reçus,
Et vins ici pour apprendre quelle douloureuse destinée
Vous avait torturés, et comment je pourrais le mieux
Vous consoler dans ce malheur extrême.
Acceptez la vérité, et qu'elle soit votre baume.»
Fut-ce par conviction embarrassée, fut-ce par dédain,
Qu'ils gardèrent le silence, lorsque Océanus
Cessa son murmure, quelle sagacité très profonde le dira?
Mais il en fut ainsi; personne ne répondit pendant un certain temps,
Sauf une, dont personne ne s'occupait, Clymène;
Et encore ne répondit-elle pas, mais geignit seulement,
Les lèvres hectiques, les yeux humbles, levés,
S'exprimant avec timidité devant ce farouche auditoire:
«O Père, je suis ici la voix la plus naïve,
Et tout ce que je sais c'est que la joie a fui
Et que la pensée du malheur a envahi nos cœurs,
Pour y demeurer à jamais, comme je le redoute:
Je ne présagerais pas de danger, si je croyais
Qu'une créature aussi débile pût attirer l'aide
Qui devrait, en bonne justice, nous venir des Dieux puissants:
Laissez-moi, toutefois, dire mon chagrin, dire
Ce que j'ai entendu, et comment cela fit couler mes larmes
D'apprendre que tout espoir nous était interdit.
[Pg 353]J'étais sur un rivage, un rivage charmant
Sur lequel était soufflé un climat[1] exquis d'une terre
Parfumée, pleine de quiétude, d'arbres et de fleurs.
Pleine aussi elle était de joie paisible, autant que je le suis de tristesse,
Trop pleine de joie, de calme et de délicieuse chaleur;
Au point que je ressentis un mouvement au cœur
Pour murmurer, pour déplorer cette solitude
En exhalant des chansons plaintives, musique de nos infortunes;
Je m'assis et saisis une coquille entr'ouverte
Puis soupirai dedans et composai une mélodie—
Oh! assez de mélodie! car tandis que je chantais,
Et faisais, avec peu d'adresse, résonner dans la brise
Le faible écho de la coquille, des ombrages d'une rive
Opposée, une île de la mer,
Les vents changeants m'apportèrent un enchantement,
Qui à la fois engourdit et excita mes oreilles.
Je jetai ma coquille au loin sur le sable,
Bientôt une vague la remplit comme mon ouïe était remplie
De cette mélodie inconnue, enivrante et dorée.
Une mort vivante était dans chaque bouffée de sons,
[Pg 354]Chaque groupe de notes précipitées me ravissait,
Elles tombaient l'une après l'autre, et pourtant en même temps
Comme des perles s'échappant subitement de leur fil:
Puis encore un autre, puis un autre son,
Chacun semblable à une colombe quittant son perchoir d'olivier,
Avec une musique ailée au lieu de plumes silencieuses,
Pour voltiger autour de ma tête et me faire souffrir
Simultanément de joie et de tristesse. La tristesse l'emporta
Et je bouchais mes oreilles frénétiques
Lorsqu'à travers l'obstacle de mes tremblantes mains,
Une voix m'arriva plus suave, plus suave que toute harmonie,
Et sans cesse elle s'écriait: «Apollon! Jeune Apollon!
Apollon, splendeur du matin: jeune Apollon!»
Je m'enfuis, la voix me poursuivait, criant «Apollon»!
O mon Père, o mes Frères, si vous aviez éprouvé
Ma douleur; O Saturne, si tu l'avais éprouvée,
Vous n'appelleriez pas cette langue trop longtemps entendue
Présomptueuse, parce qu'elle osa espérer être écoutée par vous.»

Jusque là, ses paroles coulèrent, comme le ruisseau timoré
Qui s'attarde sur un lit de cailloux
[Pg 355]Et craint de se rencontrer avec la mer; mais il la rencontra
Et frémit; car la voix écrasante
De l'énorme Encelade l'engloutit avec impétuosité:
Les syllabes massives, comme des flots acharnés
Dans les anfractuosités à demi submergées des récifs,
Bondirent en grondant, tandis que sur son bras encore
Il s'appuyait; il ne se leva pas, par suprême mépris:
«Ecouterons-nous le géant trop sage,
Ou celui, qui est trop fou, ô Dieux?
Ni foudre sur foudre, jusqu'à ce que tout
L'arsenal du rebelle Jupiter soit épuisé,
Ni monde sur monde accumulés sur ces épaules,
Ne pourraient me supplicier plus que ces paroles puériles
Prononcées dans cette horrible déchéance.
Pérorez, grondez, clamez, hurlez! vous tous, Titans endormis!
Oubliez-vous les meurtrissures et les coups flétrissants?
N'avez vous pas été foudroyés par le bras d'un enfant?
Oublies-tu, faux Monarque des Vagues,
Le bouleversement de tes mers? Quoi, ai-je réveillé
Vos torpeurs avec ces quelques mots si simples?
O joie! car maintenant je vois que vous n'êtes pas perdus:
O joie! car maintenant je vois des milliers de regards
Lançant des éclairs de vengeance!» Sur ces paroles
Il redressa sa haute stature, et debout
Cette fois, sans aucune interruption, il continua ainsi:
[Pg 356]«Maintenant que vous voilà flammes, je vous dirai comment il faut brûler,
Et purger l'éther de vos ennemis;
Comment aiguiser les dards crochus de l'impitoyable feu,
Comment incendier les nuages gonflés de Jupiter,
Etouffant dans sa tente cette chétive essence.
Oh! qu'il soit victime du mal qu'il a fait!
Car bien que je dédaigne les leçons d'Océanus
Je ressens des douleurs autrement poignantes que celle de perdre nos couronnes:
Les jours de paix et de calme sommeil sont envolés;
Ces jours, tous innocents des guerres destructives,
Alors que toutes les loyales Existences du ciel
Ouvraient les yeux pour deviner ce que nous voulions dire:
C'était avant que nos fronts eussent appris à se plisser,
Avant que nos lèvres n'eussent connu que des phrases solennelles,
Avant que nous eussions appris que cette chose ailée,
La victoire, peut être perdue, aussi bien que gagnée.
Surtout n'oubliez pas qu'Hypérion
Notre frère le plus brillant est encore invaincu—
Hypérion—Io! Voici son rayonnement!»

Tous les yeux étaient tournés vers Encelade,
Et ils aperçurent, à l'instant où le nom d'Hypérion
Sortit de ses lèvres, sur la crête des rochers en coupole,
Une lueur blafarde émanant de son visage rigide,
[Pg 357]Sans être farouche, car il vit l'Assemblée des Dieux
Courroucée comme lui. Il les regarda tous
Et sur chaque face il distingua une lueur légère,
Mais la plus étincelante sur celle de Saturne, dont les boucles vénérables
Scintillaient semblables à une écume bouillonnante autour d'une quille
Lorsque la proue pénètre dans une baie à minuit.
Ils observèrent un silence pâle et argenté,
Jusqu'à ce que soudain, une splendeur comme celle de l'aube,
Illuminât toutes les parties saillantes des rocs sombres,
Tous les tristes espaces oubliés,
Chaque gouffre, chaque fissure antique,
Chaque hauteur et chaque lugubre profondeur,
Sans autre bruit que celui des rauques torrents et leur terrifiant tracas:
Alors toutes les cataractes éternelles,
Et les fleuves fougueux, les plus éloignés et les plus proches,
Enveloppés d'abord dans l'obscurité et l'ombre immense,
Maintenant reflétèrent la lumière et la rendirent aveuglante.
C'était Hypérion: sur un pic de granit
Ses pieds brillants étaient posés, et là, il s'arrêta pour contempler
La misère que sa splendeur avait dévoilée
A la plus odieuse vue de soi-même.
[Pg 358]Dorés étaient ses cheveux aux courtes boucles Numidiennes[2],
Royale était sa forme majestueuse, ombre imposante
Au milieu de son propre éclat, telle paraît la masse
De la statue de Memnon, quand le soleil se couche,
Au voyageur qui vient de l'Orient brunissant:
Des soupirs aussi, lamentables comme ceux de la harpe de Memnon,
Sortaient de sa poitrine, pendant qu'absorbe dans son examen
Il pressait ses mains et restait silencieux.
Le découragement ressaisit les Dieux déchus
Lorsqu'ils virent l'abattement du Souverain du Jour.
Beaucoup se cachèrent la face dans l'obscurité.
Mais l'indomptable Encelade fixement jeta les yeux
Sur ses frères; et sous leur flamme
Se leva Iäpetus, de même que Creüs,
Et Phorcus, issu de la mer: ensemble ils se dirigèrent
Vers l'éminence d'où il les dominait.
Là tous quatre proclamèrent le nom du vieux Saturne;
Hypérion de son pic, à haute voix, répondait «Saturne!»
Saturne était assis auprès de la mère des Dieux,
Sur sa physionomie ne se reflétait aucune joie, quoique tous les Dieux
Du fond de leur gorge fissent retentir le nom de «Saturne».
[1] Clime: Climat. Cette terre surnaturelle faisait en quelque sorte, naître sur ce rivage favorisé, sous l'action du souffle qui émanait d'elle, un climat idéal, c'est-à-dire, l'ensemble des perfections que les humains souhaitent pour leur patrie: la quiétude, une atmosphère embaumée et saine, la fertilité, etc.

[2] Même observation que pour les boucles druidiques.

[Pg 359]

LIVRE III
C'est ainsi que tour à tour tumultueux puis anéantis par le découragement
Ces Titans étaient plongés dans la consternation la plus absolue.
O laisse-les, Muse! O laisse-les à leur malheur!
Car tu n'as pas assez de vigueur pour chanter de tels conflits.
Une douleur solitaire convient mieux
A tes lèvres, un hymne à la désespérance d'un seul.
Laisse-les, ô Muse! Tu trouveras bientôt
Plus d'une ancienne Divinité tombée
Errant à l'aventure sur des rivages inconnus.
En attendant, touche pieusement la harpe de Delphes,
Et aucune autre qu'une brise céleste n'exhalera,
Pour l'accompagner, un doux gazouillement à travers la flûte Dorienne;
Car Io! c'est en l'honneur du père de tous les vers.
Nuance tout ce qui a une teinte vermillon
Que la rose s'épanouisse et réchauffe l'atmosphère;
Que les nuées du soir et du matin
Flottent comme de voluptueuses toisons au-dessus des coteaux;
Que le vin écarlate écume dans le gobelet
[Pg 360]Frais comme une source bouillonnante; que les coquilles aux bords décolorés,
Sur le sable, ou sous les insondables profondeurs deviennent pourpres
Dans tous leurs circuits; que la vierge
Rougisse vivement, comme surprise par quelque ardent baiser!
Ile, la plus belle des Cyclades aux berceaux feuillus,
Réjouis-toi, Délos, de tes oliviers verts,
De tes peupliers, de tes palmiers ombrageant les clairières, de tes hêtres,
Dans lesquels le zéphir souffle ses chants les plus sonores,
De tes touffus coudriers aux tiges brunes, vivant sous l'ombre:
Apollon, une fois de plus est le thème doré!
Où était-il, lorsque le Géant du Soleil
Se tenait resplendissant au milieu de ses pairs affligés?
Il avait laissé ensemble sa majestueuse mère
Et sa sœur jumelle sommeillant sous leur bosquet;
A travers la lueur indécise du matin, il vagabondait
Parmi les oseraies d'un ruisseau,
Enfoncé jusqu'à la cheville dans les lys du vallon.
Le rossignol s'était tu; quelques rares étoiles
S'attardaient aux cieux et la grive
Cessait de chanter. Dans toute l'île
Il n'y avait ni fourré ni caverne
Où ne retentît le bruit crépitant des vagues
[Pg 361]Quoiqu'il fût presque assourdi en mainte retraite verdoyante.
Il écoutait; il pleurait, et ses larmes scintillaient
En tombant goutte à goutte sur l'arc doré qu'il tenait.
Ainsi ses yeux à moitié clos étaient obscurcis par les pleurs,
Lorsque, de dessous une branche rugueuse lui barrant le chemin,
Sortit d'un pas solennel une altière Déesse.
Dans le coup d'œil qu'elle lui jeta, il y avait une intention
Qu'avec une prompte divination il commença à discerner,
Perplexe; immédiatement il lui dit d'une voix mélodieuse:
«Comment as-tu traversé l'infranchissable mer?
Cet antique aspect et cette robe qui t'enveloppe
Ont-ils parcouru ces vallées, invisibles jusqu'à cette heure?
Sûrement, j'ai entendu ces vêtements froisser
Les feuilles tombées, lorsque je m'asseyais solitaire
Au cœur de la fraîche forêt. Sûrement j'ai suivi
Le bruissement de cette simple jupe au milieu
De ces prairies désertes, et j'ai vu les fleurs
Lever leurs têtes, comme tu les frôlais en passant.
Déesse! J'ai déjà contemplé tes yeux,
Et leur calme éternel, et tous tes traits,
Ou j'ai rêvé».—«Oui, répondit la forme souveraine,
Tu as rêvé de moi; en t'éveillant
Tu as trouvé une lyre tout en or à ton côté.
[Pg 362]Lorsque tu en pinces les cordes avec tes doigts, la vaste
Oreille de l'univers entier, sans se lasser jamais,
Ecoute avec tristesse ou joie la source d'où jaillit
Une harmonie si neuve et si merveilleuse. N'est-il pas étrange
Que tu pleures, étant ainsi doué? Jeune Ephèbe, dis-moi
Quel chagrin tu peux éprouver: car je suis attristée
Lorsque tu verses une larme: raconte tes malheurs
A quelqu'un qui dans cette île déserte a
Veillé sur ton sommeil et tes heures de vie,
Depuis tes jeunes journées où pour la première fois ton enfantine main
Arrachait sans réflexion les faibles fleurs, jusqu'à l'heure où ton bras
Put bander cet arc héroïque en tout instant.
Dévoile le secret de ton cœur à une Déesse des temps anciens
Qui a abandonné son trône antique et sacré
Pour annoncer ton règne et pour sauvegarder
Ta beauté nouvelle venue». Apollon alors
La scruta soudain de ses yeux déjà moins dolents;
Ainsi lui répondit-il, et de sa gorge blanche et mélodieuse
Les sanglots sortaient avec les mots: «Mnémosyne!
Ton nom est sur ma langue, j'en ignore la raison;
Pourquoi te dire ce que tu as si bien deviné?
Pourquoi m'efforcer de t'expliquer le mystère que tes lèvres
[Pg 363]Expriment si clairement? Pour moi, sombre, sombre
Et douloureux est l'infâme oubli qui scelle mes yeux:
Je m'efforce de découvrir pour quel motif je suis affligé
Au point que le chagrin engourdit mes membres;
Alors je m'assieds sur l'herbe, et je gémis
Comme quelqu'un qui naguère a eu des ailes. O pourquoi
Me sentirais-je maudit et meurtri, lorsque l'air encore sans maître
Se soumet à ma course ambitieuse? Pourquoi foulerais-je
Avec mépris la terre verdoyante comme si elle repoussait mes pas?
Déesse bienveillante, indique-moi quelque espace inconnu:
N'y a-t-il pas d'autres régions que cette île?
Que sont les étoiles? Voilà le soleil, le soleil!
Et la lueur si maladive de la lune!
Et les étoiles par milliers! Indique-moi la route
Vers quelque étoile ravissante spécialement,
Et j'y volerai avec ma lyre,
Et ferai palpiter de bonheur sa splendeur argentée.
J'ai entendu le tonnerre dans les nuages: Qui le gouverne?
Quelle main, quelle essence, quelle divinité
Déchaîne cette tempête dans les éléments,
Tandis que oisif, j'écoute sur les rivages
Sans la redouter, mais dans une douloureuse ignorance?
Oh! dis-moi, solitaire Déesse, par ta harpe
[Pg 364]Qui gémit chaque soir et chaque matin,
Dis-moi pourquoi je délire ainsi sur ses grèves!
Tu restes muette.—Muette! cependant je peux lire
Une merveilleuse leçon sur ta silencieuse face:
Une science prodigieuse qui fait un Dieu de moi.
Noms, actions, contes bleus, sinistres malheurs, rébellions,
Majestés, voix souveraines, agonies,
Créations et destructions, en même temps
Se déversent dans les vastes replis de mon cerveau,
Et me déifient, comme si quelque vin joyeux
Ou quelque incomparable élixir m'avait enivré de sa chaleur,
Et rendu de la sorte immortel.» Ainsi parla le Dieu,
Pendant que ses yeux enflammés, regardant droit devant eux
Au-dessous de ses tempes blanches et veloutées, tremblotaient
Sans discontinuer en fixant Mnémosyne.
Bientôt une brusque commotion la secoua et fit rougir
Toutes les immortelles beautés de ses membres,
Beaucoup comme l'agonie aux confins de la mort;
Plus encore comme quelqu'un qui veut se dégager
De l'étreinte de la pâle et immortelle mort, et, brûlé par un horrible mal
Aussi cuisant que celui de la mort est glacé, dans une horrible convulsion
Meurt tout vivant. Ainsi le jeune Apollon était angoissé:
Ses cheveux, ses boucles dorées si renommées
[Pg 365]Ondulaient le long de son cou gonflé.
Pendant cette minute douloureuse Mnémosyne élevait
Les bras au-dessus de sa tête comme une prophétesse.
—Enfin
Apollon poussa un cri strident;—et Io! de tous ses membres
Divins. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

[Pg 367]

LA VISION[1]
«Nul ne peut usurper cette place élevée, répliqua cette ombre,
Sauf ceux pour lesquels les misères du monde
Sont un malheur et ne leur laisseront aucun repos.
Tous les autres qui trouvent ici-bas un port,
Où ils puissent insoucieusement passer leurs jours dans le sommeil,
Si par aventure ils pénètrent dans ce temple
Pourrissent sur le dallage là où tu es à demi putréfié»
«Ne sont-ils pas des milliers au monde dans ce cas?» dis-je
Encouragé par la voix affable de l'ombre;
«Quels êtres aiment leurs amis même jusqu'à la mort?
Qui perçoit la géante agonie du monde?
Bien plus, comme des esclaves de la pauvre humanité,
[Pg 368]Lesquels travaillent pour un bien mortel? Sûrement je verrais
D'autres hommes ici, mais j'y suis seul.»
«Ceux dont tu parles ne sont pas des visionnaires,
Rétorqua la voix; ce ne sont pas de faibles rêveurs;
Ils ne recherchent pas d'autre prodige que le visage humain,
D'autre musique que la voix joyeusement timbrée;
Ils ne viennent pas ici, ils n'ont pas de pensée pour y venir,
Toi, tu es ici, car tu es moins qu'eux.
Quel bienfait peux-tu apporter, toi ou tout ton clan,
Pour le vaste univers? Tu es une chose rêveuse,
Une fièvre de toi-même: pense à la terre:
Quelle béatitude, même en espérance, y a-t-il là pour toi?
Quel port? Chaque créature a son foyer,
Chaque homme isolé a ses jours de joie et de peine,
Que ses travaux soient sublimes ou terre à terre—
Ici la peine, là la joie, chacune à part:
Le rêveur seul empoisonne tous ses jours,
En proie à plus de maux que n'en méritent ses péchés.
Donc que cette félicité soit en partie partagée,
De telles choses semblables à toi sont souvent admises
Dans ces jardins que tu as traversés tout à l'heure
Et tolérées dans ces temples.»
[1] Fragment cité dans l'ouvrage de Colvin sur Keats comme un remaniement d'Hypérion.

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

JOHDANTO.
John Keats'in kuolemasta tulee pian kuluneeksi sata vuotta. Kuitenkaan ei ole vielä, tietääkseni, ilmestynyt suomenkielellä yhtään näytettä tämän nerokkaan runoilijan tuotannosta. Siihen on luonnolliset syynsä. Onhan meidän kirjallisuuttamme vasta juur'ikään alettukin suuremmassa määrässä kartuttaa eteviä ulkomaisia runoteoksia kääntämällä. Toisekseen on runouden harrastus ja itse runouskin meillä näihin asti saanut virikettä paljon enemmän Skandinaviasta, Saksasta ja Ranskasta kuin Englannista. Sen ovat vaikuttaneet sivistysperinnöt sekä kieliopinnoissa vallitsevat olot yhdessä muiden seikkain kanssa, jotka ylläpitävät kulttuuriyhteyttä eri maiden kesken. Kuitenkin on englantilainen runous, niinkuin tiedetään, tavattoman rikas. Siitä ovat jo suomalaisellekin yleisölle pysyväisenä muistuttajana Paavo Cajanderin suurisuuntaiset Shakespeare-suomennokset. Mutta jos emme, runoudesta puhuessamme, ota huomioon vanhemman suomalaisen kirjallisuuden Scott- ja Dickens-niteitä, Robinsonia, Gulliveria ja sentapaisia, emmekä viime aikoina ilmestyneitä Shawin ja Wilden teoksia, on meidän kirjallisuuteemme Shakespeare-suomennosten lisäksi tullut Englannin kirjallisuudesta ylen vähän runouden näytteitä.

Nyt ilmestyvä pieni nide Keats-suomennoksia ei ole alun alkaen syntynyt suunnitelman mukaisesti, vaan on suomentaja, vanhasta rakkaudesta runoilijaan, ensin käännellyt hänen runojaan omaksi ilokseen. Vasta kun suomennoksia alkoi karttua, rupesin ajattelemaan niiden julkaisemista kirjasena ja ryhdyin suomentamaan pienempäin runoelmain lisäksi Hyperionia, jonka katsoin sopivaksi täydentämään valikoimaa, jos kokoelma kaikessa vaatimattomuudessaan voisi ilmestyttyään tuottaa tyydytystä lukijoille, niinkuin sen valmistaminen on tuottanut iloa suomentajalle, niin se olisi paras palkinto työstä, joka ei ole tehty ilman vaivaa, vaikka kyllä halulla ja hartaudella.

Niitä lukijoita varten, jotka eivät Keats'iä ollenkaan tunne, viitattakoon tässä lyhykäisesti hänen elämäänsä ja tuotantoonsa.

John Keats (luetaan Kiits) syntyi Lontoossa 1795. Hänen isänsä oli ajuri, ja itse hän joutui, alkuopinnot suoritettuaan, ansaitsemaan leipäänsä apteekki-apulaisena, kunnes sai pienen perinnön ja päätti sen turvissa antautua yksinomaan runoilijakutsumukselleen. Runous oli vallannut hänen mielensä jo nuorena koululaisena, jolloin hän m.m. käänsi englanniksi Vergiliuksen Aeneidin. Mutta runolliselle kutsumuksellekaan ei hänen ollut suotu uhrata pitkää aikaa. Hän sairastui rintatautiin, jota oli suvussa, ja päätti, kun ei enää muuta toivoa ollut, matkustaa Italiaan, jossa terveyden toivottiin palaavan. Mutta siellä tapasikin hänet pian kuolema.

Kuollessaan, kevät-talvella 1821, oli runoilija vasta 25 vuotta täyttänyt nuorukainen. Mutta niistä runoelmista, mitä hän jätti jälkeensä, ovat useat mailmankirjallisuudessa vertaansa etsiviä mestariteoksia.

Paitsi runottarien seurasta, jossa Keats eli elämänsä rikkaimmat hetket, sai hän elinaikansa loppupuolella nauttia erään nuoren tytön rakkaudesta, jota hän itse rakasti tulisesti. Asuessaan noin puoli vuotta rakastettunsa, neiti Fanny Brawnen, läheisyydessä maalla, kirjoitti Keats siellä muutamat kauneimmista runoelmistaan. Mutta ainoastaan harvoina hetkinä oli hänelle rakkaudestakaan lohdutusta. Päinvastoin painoi se ja kidutti hänen ylenmäärin levotonta sydäntään. Rauhaa hän ei löytänyt mistään lyhyessä elämässään. Mutta kauneus vei hänet valtoihinsa, missä ikinä sitä olikaan, ja runous oli hänen elämänsä suurin rakkaus. Kauneudenpa hän juuri on omissa runoissaankin jättänyt kuolemattomaksi perinnöksi jälkimailmalle — "iloks ikuiseksi", joksi hän itse kauneutta sanoo.

Enemmän kuin useimmille muille taiteilijoille, jotka kaikki tahtonevat palvella kauneutta, oli se keskeistä Keats'in elämälle ja runoudelle. Kauneuden jano oli suorastaan hänen suurin intohimonsa. Hänen runoilija-laadulleen oli niinikään perikuvallista se, mikä myöskin vastasi koko hänen olemustaan, että se oli harvinaisen suuressa määrässä ulkonaisten aistimuksien vallassa. Aistivaikutelmat ikäänkuin piirittivät hänet joka taholta, ja mistä hän runoilikin, jäi niistä hänen säkeisiinsä ja rytmeihinsä lähtemättömät kuvat, värit, tuoksut ja tuntemukset. Ulkonaisten aistimuksien runsautta vallitsi Keats'illä lisäksi sellainen näkemyksen intensiivisyys ja mielikuvituksen voima, joka hakee vertojaan. Loppupuolella runoilijan tuotantokautta alkoi hänen luonnon-hurmionsa ja kauneus-paatoksensa tyventyä ja seljetä. Hänen henkensä tavoitteli jo kaiken inhimillisen elämän rajatuntoja ja mittaili jumalallisten elementtien syvyyksiä.

Sekä muodon että sisällyksen puolesta voi Keats'in runoudesta sanoa, että siinä on luonto ja kulttuuri liittyneenä harvinaisen eheäksi ja sopusointuiseksi yhtymäksi.

Kaikkein suurinta Keats'in runoudessa on sen eetillinen jalous. Vaikka hänen oma lyhyt elämänsä oli täynnä henkilökohtaista kärsimystä, ei se missään ole päässyt antamaan vallitsevaa leimaa hänen runoudelleen. Se on aina puhdasta ja kirkasta. Sellaiset usein toistuvat motiivit kuin kestävän onnen kaipuu ja kuoleman odotus vain todistavat, että se nuori elämä, josta tämä runous pulppusi, oli ylen totista ja vakavaa.

Kirjallis-historiallisesti kuuluu Keats siihen voimakkaaseen renesanssi-polveen, jonka kunniasijaa Englannin kirjallisuudessa yhdessä hänen nimensä kanssa ylläpitävät sellaiset nimet kuin Shelley ja Byron. Se on kuolematon kolmikko, joka tulee mailmankirjallisuudessa aina näkymään kauas yli kotimaansa rajojen.

Tähän kokoelmaan otetuissa runoissa ei ole yhtään Keats'in aikaisimman nuoruuden tuotetta. Hänen ensimäisestä runokokoelmastaan, joka ilmestyi 1817, ei suomennoksissa niinollen ole näytettä. Klassillis-aiheinen, laaja romanttinen runoelma Endymion, jonka alkusäkeet on suomennettu tämän kirjasen alkuun nimellä Kauneus, ja johon myöskin sisältyy Paanin kuoro, valmistui pääasiassa 1817 ja sen ensi osa julkaistiin seuraavana vuonna. 1818 kirjoitettu on Oodi toukokuulle. Tänä samana vuonna sai runoilija jo kuolettavan sairautensa, ja samoihin aikoihin hän koki ensimäiset vastahakoisuudet ilkeä-mielisen arvostelun taholta. Saman vuoden lopulla hän tutustui Fanny Brawneen. Hyperionin aloitti runoilija talvikautena 1818-1819, mutta jätti sen kokonaan keskeneräiseksi seuraavana syksynä, valmistettuaan runoelmaa vähän kolmatta laulua (julk. 1820), joista kaksi nyt ilmestyy suomeksi. Vuodelta 1819 ovat m.m. Oodi satakielelle ja Syksylle, seuraavalta vuodelta Oodi kreikkalaiselle uurnalle ja Oodi melankolialle (Alakuloisuuden oodi). Vasta runoilijan kuoltua julkaistuja ovat kaikki suomennoskokoelmaan otetut "sonetit", Huolettomuuden oodi, Oodi toukokuulle ja Säkeitä.

Mitä tulee alkutekstin seuraamiseen suomennoksissa, tahdon mainita, että olen, sikäli kuin englanninkieltä paljon "pitempi" suomenkieli on sallinut, koettanut noudattaa runoilijan tekstiä mahdollisimman tarkasti. Luonnollisesti on, etenkin oodeissa ja soneteissa, täytynyt uhrata koko joukko runoilijalle ominaisesta kuvien ja näkemysten runsaudesta soinnun ja ajatuksen yhtenäisyyden säilyttämiseksi suomennoksessa, mutta ainoastaan harvassa paikassa on kuva tai ajatuksen käänne korvattu toisella. Vielä läheisemmin on Hyperion alkutekstiä vastaava.

Muutamia Keats'in runoja on Per Hallström julkaissut oivallisina ruotsinnoksina essee-kokoelmassaan "Levande dikt" (ilm. 1914; ainoat Keats-ruotsinnokset, mitä lienee olemassakaan). Ne ovat olleet suomennostyölleni esimerkiksi ja avuksikin.

Vaasa, syyskuussa 1917.

KAUNEUS ("Endymion")

Mi kaunist' on, on iloks ikuiseksi. Sen sulo kasvaa päiväin tyveneksi ja öiden levoks armain unelmin. Ei katoa se ajan pimeihin, vaan uudistuupi yhä. Siksi teemme me joka aamu kukkaseppeleemme ja luottain kumarrumme puoleen maan. Kuink' epätoivo itää rinnassaan, kuink' etsii turhaan sydänt' ylevää täält' ihminen; vaikk' elon määrää nää hän ei, kun hämärtyy ja tummuu tie, — jos milloin liki kauneutta se vie, niin katso, mielensä jo kirkastuu! Niin on kuun, auringon, niin joka puun, jonk' alle lepoon lehvin varjottuun voit mieles viihdyttää, ken lienetkin; niin myskiruusujen ja narsissin, ja mailman vihannan, joss' elää ne, ja puron kirkkaan, jonka kuplille maa kuvastuu ja taivas: kaikki nuo sen matkaansaattaa. Saman onnen suo myös kuvittelu kuolon suuruuden tai elon taru, runo suloinen. Se ihmislapsen ikijuomaa on, jot' antaa taivas, lähde loputon.

OODI SATAKIELELLE.
    Mun polttaa sydäntän', mua unettaa,
      oon raukea, oon kuolon uupunut,
    kuin juonut oisin valmun hunajaa
      tai katkoyrtin mettä maistellut.
    En ole kateinen sun onnestas,
      yön laulajatar, henki metsän puun,
        vaan liian onnellinen itsekin,
          kun taika-lehdossas,
      suus puhjetessa suven lauleluun,
        puut ympäröi mua lehvin varjoisin.
    Ah, maljan viiniä ken mulle tois,
      maan mullan tuoksuvaista, viileää,
    joss' auringon ja ajan kaiho ois
      ja laulun, tanssin, lemmen ikävää!
    Oi malja täysi maiden lämpöisten,
      jonk' elon neste kirkas punertais,
        jok' yltä läikkyis kuplin kuohuvin,
          nyt joisin pohjaan sen, —
      maan harhat unhottuis ja katoais
        sun kanssas tumman metsän kätköihin.
    Pois unhon maille, kohtaloista pois,
      joit' oksillas ei suotu elää sun,
    täält' iäks pakohon ken päästä vois,
      maast', uupumuksen, vihan, voihkailun,
    miss' avutonna tutjuu harmaa pää,
      ja nuoruus kalvettuu ja kaatuilee,
        miss' aatella on tulla suruiseksi
          ja tuska täydentää,
      miss' silmät kauneuden sumenee
        ja lempi riutuu loppuun huomeneksi.
    Pois luokses paeta ma tahtoisin,
      en Bakkus-kulkueessa, pantterein,
    vaan runon siivin kuulumattomin,
      joit' avuks vartoo tylsä aatoksein.
    Nyt luonas jo! Yö hiljaa hengittää,
      kuu kuningatar tähtisaatossaan
        tuoll' liikkuu, yhtä loistavainen ain,
          vaan tääll' on himmeää,
      miss' sammalteiden tummaan vihantaan
        yön tuuli kevein huulin koskee vain.
    En kukkaa ruohostossa nähdä voi,
      en silmin tunne oksaa tuoksuvaa,
    vaan tuoksut kaikki, joita kevät toi,
      joill' öin ja päivin suvi kaunistaa
    maan ruohon, viidakon ja villin puun,
      ne tunnen jo: tuoss' ujon orvokin,
        tuoss' orapihlajan; myös tuttu tuo
          on umppu toukokuun,
      jost' aukee myskiviini kasteisin
        ja suven riemun mettisille suo.
    Näin monasti, yön rauhaa nauttien,
      oon kaipaellut kuolon lepohon,
    oon nimin rakkain runoellut sen,
      viel' etsien sua, saavuttamaton.
    Nyt rikkaampaa kuin ennen kuolla ois
      sun turvahasi, yö ja unhoitus,
        kun innon hurmausta tulvillaan
          noin suuri laulus sois!
      Sois vieläkin, kuin viime rukous —
        ei enää mulle, tomulleni vaan.
    Sa kuolematon oot, oot ikuinen!
      Ei kehnot sukupolvet tallanneet
    sua, jonka ääntä ajan ammoisen
      on keisarit ja orjat kuunnelleet;
    tuon laulus lohtuisan jo kuulla voi
      Ruut suruinen, kun kotiin itkien
        hän seisoi vainioilla vieraan maan,
          ja sama laulu soi,
      miss' aallot teiltä meren kuohujen
        toi eksyneen taas rantaan rauhaisaan.
    Toi eksyneen! Nuo sanat kutsuu pois
      mun luotas elämäni köyhyyteen!
    Kuink' onnen kultaa mielikuvat ois,
      ei pettää voi ne peikon-taruineen.
    Jää hyvästi! Jo virtes vaikertaa,
      jo raukee laaksoon, virtaan hiljaiseen
        ja kankahalle, viimein vaieten
          pois kukkuloiden taa.
      On laannut soitto. Mitä itse teen?
        Kaikk' unta vaan? Sen näinkö valvoen?
ALAKULOISUUDEN OODI.
    Ei, ällös turvaa Lethen aaltoihin,
      äl' ukonhatun myrkkyyn mehuiseen,
    äl' otsaas kalpeata suudelmin
      suo pettää koison tumman rypäleen
    tai katajaisten kaihoseppelten;
      yöperhon ystävyyttä ällös tee,
        ja seuraan untuvaisten huuhkajain
    äl' usko salaisuutta sydämmen!
      kun varjo yhtyy varjoon, himmenee
        sun mieles yhä, surus puutuu vain.
    Vaan alakuloisuus kun lankeaa
      sun päälles lailla pilven itkevän,
    jok' kukat kuihtuvaiset virvoittaa
      ja kostuttaapi kummun vihreän,
    niin viivy siellä, suru mukanas,
      miss' aamuntuore ruusu hohtelee
        tai sateenkaari kuvans' aaltoon luo;
    tai jos on suuttunut sun armahas,
      niin kätens' ota, vangikses se tee,
        ja syvään, syvään silmän hurmaa juo.
    Se seuraa kauneutta katoovaa,
      ja iloa, jok' yhä huulilleen
    vie kättään hyvästiks, ja hekkumaa,
      mist' yks on askel kipuun karvaaseen.
    Niin, itse temppelissä riemujen
      on hunnutettu kaiho kätköss' ain,
        mut nähdä saa sen vain, ken kiirehtää
    ja nauttii ilon heelmän tuorehen:
      hän tietää, miss' on suru autuain,
        ja ainiaaks sen pyhäkköihin jää.
OODI KREIKKALAISELLE UURNALLE.
    Sa koskematon rauhan morsian,
      laps aika-äidin aina hiljaisen,
    sun metsän-tarinasi kukkivan
      on eessä runo vaiti, kuunnellen!
    Sun legendasi lehdin verhotut
      on Arkadian, Tempen laaksoissa.
        Mut käykö kohtaloista kuolevain
    vai jumalten tuo taisto katkera?
      Mist' inha vaino, immen huokailut?
        Miks pillit, rummut, hurma tanssijain?
    On sävel korvin kuultu suloinen,
      vaan kuulumaton suloisemmin soi.
    Siks, pillit, soikaa taas - ei kuullaksen',
      vaan minkä sydän vastaan ottaa voi:
    mies nuori seisoo tuossa, soittaa vain,
      puut ikuisesti kantaa vihreää;
        tuo nuorukainen lemmen hurmassaan
    ei suudelmaansa saa, vaikk' anoo ain, —
      oi, lempes lakastu ei konsanaan,
        ja armahas ain ihanaiseks jää!
    Oi oksat onnekkaat, joit' ikänään
      ei tapaa syys, vaikk' keväät vaihtuis kuin;
    mies onnellinen, ken noin nostaa pään
      ain uusin soitoin, uusin lauleluin;
    viel' onnekkaampi lempi, lempi oot,
      noin altis, uskollinen, lämpöinen,
        suur' iäti ja nuori ainian,
    kuink' intohimot muita polttakoot
      vain syömmen surun-täyden jättäen
        ja otsan kuuman, kielen janoovan.
    Ken outo, mystillinen pappi liet,
      jok' ammuvaa ja arkaa hiehoa
    tuoss' alttarille vihreälle viet?
      Ja kansa, jonk' on mieli uhrata?
    Ja minkä pienen meren-kauppalan
      tai vuoren turvallisen kaupungin
        tuo joukko jätti, vaeltaen pois?
    Vaikk' aavistat sen yhä vartovan,
      kuin iät kaiket, kaduin hiljaisin,
        et tiedä miks - ken kertoa sen vois?
    Oi kuva Attikan! Sun kohtalos,
      sun hahmos, kirjaellut marmoriin,
    puus lehtevät ja puhtaat ruohikkos
      mun tempaa aatoksista unelmiin
    kuin iäisyys! Tää suku iloton
      kun vanhuudest' on kaatunut, sa jäät,
        ja läpi uutten tuskain, suurempain,
    mit' uudet uskottus ei nää, sa näät:
      "On kaunis totta, tosi kaunist' on."
        Se muistaos, muu kaikk' on turhuus vain.
PAANIN KUORO. ("Endymion")

'Oi valtias sa linnan varjoisen, jonk' ylle huojuen ja humisten puut suuret lehviänsä levittää ja suopi rauhaa, suopi hämärää, miss' elää nimettömin kukkasin maan ruohot tuhannet ja kuoleekin; miss' usein ilonas on katsella, kun metsänneidot suorii tukkaansa ja kypsät heelmät tummentuu ja loistaa; tai, hetket totiset kun seuraa toistaan, taas kuulla kaislain ääntä suruisaa ja nähdä, kuinka kaste kasvattaa kaikk' yrtit ylenmäärin; kaihoissas myös uneksua menneest' onnestas, kun kadotit sa armaan Syrinxin! Nyt kautta lempes kaunihin ja kautta onnes muiston autuaan — oi kuule meitä, suuri Paan!

Sua tyynnyttäin, sun mieltäs viihdytellen saat kyyhkys-äänten kuulla kaikerrellen sa soittelevan myrttein suojassa, kun illan suussa metsän rannalla tiet' aurinkoista astut miettien. Ja viikunoiden laaja-lehtisten on heelmät sulle yksin määrätyt, ja minkä hunajalla täyttänyt on mettinen, se suloks on vain sun. Myös kylän viljamailta siunatun saat osan, mitä kallist' antaakin ne kasvustaan, ja uusin sävelin sua ylistääkseen aukee laulamaan viel' uudet lintuparvet kuoristaan. Sun ilokses myös suotu mansikkain on suven-vilpoisuus, ja sulle vain saa hohtaa perhon siivet nurmikolla ja virran päivä-kuplat kauniit olla. Niin, sulle puhkee joka silmikko! Sa tullos lähellemme - joudu jo, kautt' taivaan tuulten kuusten latvassa, oi metsän jumala!

Sun luokses kiiruhtavat satyyrit ja faunit, palveluksees alttihit, jos tarvis jänö piilost' yllättää, miss' uinailee se unta pehmeää, tai jyrkänteitä ylös karata, kun kotkan suusta pelastettava on hento karitsa. Yön pimeihin kun eksyy paimenet, niin salaisin ne loihduin, houkutuksin heidät saa taas teille tuttaville johdattaa. Ne juoksee rantaa meren myrskyisen kaikk' ihmeelliset raakut poimien sun varalles, jonk' ilo verraton niit' aallotarten luoliin heittää on ja nähdä, kuinka julkeudesta tuosta ne säikkyvät, ja naurain piiloon juosta; tai kentäll' ilman aikaa loikkia, kun toiset hyppii vuoren harjalla puun käpysillä leikkisotaa käyden ja omenoilla. Kautta riemus täyden, jonk' yhä kierii kaiku saloillas, oi kuule meitä, kuningas!

Oot kuuntelija äänten kaikuvain, kun keritsimet leikkaa raksuttain pois villan määkyviltä oinailtas, oot sarven koukistaja voimakas, kun villi-karjut viljaa raastaen käy mailla metsämiesten; hallaisen myös pellon päällä henkes levähtää, ja tähkät kylläät koskematta jää; sun huokaukses raskas huminoi yl' autioitten nummien ja soi niin suruisasti synkiss' alhoissa; myös suurten arvoitusten ovella sa seisot, kaiken-tietoon johtaen. Suur' poika Dryopen — kuin moni kumartain on tullutkaan sun luokses, lehvät kulmillaan!

Viel' asuntosi raitis, rauhainen suo majaks yksinäisten aatosten, jotk' yhä mieltä ylemmäksi johtaa siks että avoinna se taivaan kohtaa; viel' anna jalon henkes koskettaa maan rantaa sumuista ja harmajaa; viel' ole äärettömän kuvana ja tunnuksena taivaan kannella, jonk' avaruutta meri heijastaa; ja alkuaineena, joll' aatos saa sen täyttää, mik' on tutkimatont' ain — vaan enempää ei. — Päämme taivuttain ja otsat peittäin verkkaan kumarramme, ja kuulkoot tähdet huudon huuliltamme, kun vannotamme eessäs nöyrtyen: meit' auta, herra vuorien!'

SYKSYLLE.
    Syys, aika usvien ja hedelmäin,
      jok' ystävältäs auringolta saat
    taas neuvot, kuinka runsain, täyteläin
      ja kypsin sato siunais puut ja maat
    ja räystään rypäleet, kuink' oksiaan
      maan puoleen omenat taas taivuttais,
        ois ydin maittavainen pähkinäin,
    viel' uudet silmut puihin puhkeais,
      ja kuinka mettiset, kun yhä vaan
      ois kesän mettä kennot tulvillaan,
        ei näkis päätä päiväin lämpimäin.
    Ken nähnyt ei sua maillas, aitoillas,
      tai riihen kynnyksellä toisinaan,
    miss' istuit kauan ilman aikojas,
      ja tuuli nostatteli tukkaas vaan;
    tai uneen vaipuneena sirppis luo,
      kun valmut elopellon petti sun,
    niin hetkeks säästäin viljan kukkineen;
    tai joskus katsellen, kun virran vuo
      sun kiiti ohitses, tai vartoin, kun
      puun lehtevän, yön kastein puetun,
        pois tihkui helmet aamuun hiljaiseen.
    Miss' on nyt kevään laulut — miss' on ne?
      Niit' älä muistele: syys vuorons' saa,
    kun iltapilvet jättää päivälle
      jo hyvästi, ja sänget punertaa,
    kun survoo hyttys-kuoro suruinen
      tuoll' alla rannan raitain nyyhkyttäin
        ja väistäin tuulen leyhkää lempeää,
    kun lammaslauma määkyy kotiin päin,
      ja sirkat aitovieress' soittaen
      kun yhtyy lauluun kultakerttusen
        ja pilviss' asti pääskyt visertää.
HUOLETTOMUUDEN OODI.
    Ol' aamuhetki. Edessäni näin
      kuin kolme kuvaa, viitoin valkoisin,
    jotk' äänetönnä liikkuin, allapäin,
      vei toinen toistaan tyynin askelin;
    ja sivuttain ne ohi kulkivat
      kuin uurnan kuvat, jonka hiljalleen
        näät kääntyvän. Ne palas uudestaan,
    yht' äänettömät, yhtä ihanat.
      Niin oli näky outo kulkueen
        kuin aaveilmestyksen alta maan.
    Kuink' olikaan, kun teit' en tuntenut?
      Noin eikö huntuverhoin peittää vois
    yön hankkeet, juonet tarkoin harkitut:
      juur' ottaa päiväs huolettomat pois,
    pois hetket armaat, tunnit joutilaat,
      kun silmäs raukee suven utuihin,
        kun valtasuones tykkii hiljaa vain
    ja ilotta ja tuskatt' olla saat!
    Pois menkää, että jälleen vaipuisin
      ma tyhjyyteen - siell' olo autuain!
    Ne kulki kolmannesti ohitsen',
      mua silmihin nyt kukin katsahtain,
    ja häipyin pois. Jo syttyi sydämmen', —
      ma näin, tunsin muodot tuttavain:
    Sun nimes, tyttö kaunis, Lempi on;
      sä olet Maine, silmin palavin
        ja kiusatuin, yön kiihko poskillas;
    ja sinä, soimattu ja osaton,
      jot' enin palvelin ja rakastin,
        oot Runous, mun elon' valtias.
    Ne häipyi pois. Ne kaihoisaks sai mun.
      Oi hulluus! Mit' on lempi miss' on se?
    Ja kunnia — vain kuumehourailun
      ja mielenharhain turha kuvite!
    Ja runous — se iloa ei suo
      niin suloisaa kuin päivän unteluus,
        kuin illan tuoksu, lepo armaan yön.
    Oi, ettei aika mulle rauhaa tuo,
      jonk' unelmissa joka päivä uus
        veis ohi maisen aatoksen ja työn!
    Ne tuli vieläkin — ah, miksi taas?
      Ma unten pimennossa uinailin,
    join kukkain rauhaa, vihreyttä maass'
      ja valon kuihtumusta varjoihin.
    Ol' aamu pilvinen, vaan sateeton,
      vaikk' kevään kyynel kiilti silmäss' sen,
        ja nuoret lehvät nuojui hiljalleen,
    ja rastas lauloi, puu sai silmikon. —
      Oi varjot, menkää pois — en itkien
        teist' eroo nyt, en kuole kaipuuseen.
    Siis jääkää hyvästi! Mua ette saa
      pois ruohon-kukkaisalta vuoteeltain.
    En kaipaa sylilampaan kunniaa,
      joll' elon ilve ruokkis kaihojain.
    Niin menkää rauhaan, hennot aavehet,
      ja uurnan uniks jälleen muuttukaa.
        Yö näkyjään suo mulle runsaimmin
    ja päivän unet viel' on kylläiset.
      Pois kadotkaatte, pilviusvain taa,
        pois, palaamatta konsaan takaisin!
SONETTI (1).
Kun pelko herää, etten elää voi siks kunnes runon syys on siunannut, mit' aatos kuuma kypsytti ja loi, ja jyvät kalliit kaikk' on korjatut;

yön totisilla kasvoilla kun nään, kuin kiertää sumut suurten runojen, ja aavistan, etten mä ehtiskään niit' tavotella kuviks iäisen;

ja kun ma tunnen, etten milloinkaan sua, hetken kirkas lapsi, nähdä saa, ja että puhtaan lemmen unholaan ma päästä voi en; — silloin vaipuu maa

ja taivas äärinensä tyhjyyteen ja rakkaus ja maine kaikkineen.

SONETTI MAINEELLE.
Se kuumesairas kiihkoinen on, ken ei tyynnä nauti elon lahjoistaan, ken ahmii ajallista hurmaa vaan, myös nimen neitseellisen uhraten,

kuin ruusu kukkans' itse pudottais tai kypsä heelmä kuoren kirkkahan, kuin aallottaret virran kuulakan ja pohjan puhtaan sameaksi sais.

Vaan ruusu, pensastosta kohoten, viel' antaa suuta tuulten, mettisten, ja heelmä koskematta hohtelee,

    ja aalto kirkas on kuin ennenkin.
    Mit' itse mailmalta ma kerjäisin?
    Sen suosio ei miestä mikskään tee.
SONETTI (2).
Miks nauroin äsken? Turhaan tiedustan: on vaiti jumalat ja henget yön, kaikk' oraakkelit taivaan, manalan. Niin käännyn puolees sunkin, ihmis-syön.

    Oi sydän, suruinen kuin minäkin:
    miks nauroin yöllä? Tuska kuoleman
    ja pimeys! En kuule helvetin,
    en taivaan, syömmen äänten vastaavan.
    Miks nauroin? Elämäni tunnen jo.
    Sen unet lentää onnen äärihin.
    Nyt kuitenkin ois kuolla nautinto,
    maan korun haihtuess' yön tuulihin.
    Suur' ompi onni runon, kunnian
    ja kauneuden, vaan suurin kuoleman.
SONETTI (3).
Yön kirkas tähti, ken ois kaltaises! Niin liikkumaton silmäs loisto on ja ajast' aikaan valvoo katsehes, kun lailla unettoman erakon

sen yli kuohuvaisten vetten luot, maan piirin rantaa puhtaaks huuhtovain, tai katselet, kuin vuorenharjat, suot syys peittää alle vaippain valkeain.

Ei — liikkumattomammin vieläkin, nuort' armastani rintaan nojaten, jonk' iäti mä kuohun tuntisin, — oi lepo levoton ja suloinen:

ain' elää, elää, vaivoin rakkauttaan, tai uupua ja kuolla povellaan.

SONETTI UNELLE.
Oi armas huoltaja yön hiljaisen, jok' autat kiinni sormin laupiain nää silmät, tuttavat jo pimeyden ja unhon lehvikköjen varjoisain:

Oi suloisin! Jos tahdot, sulkeos jo silmän' alttiit kesken virteskin, tai varro, kunnes lempeet unikkos pois tuutivat mun tuoksu-unelmin.

Suo suojaa myös, jos etsis vuoteeltain mua eilispäivä murheinen, ja jos viel' omatunto, yönkin valliten,

kuin myyrä kätköstään mua vartiois; niin käännä ovi lukkoon, armoinen, ja salli, että vaivun täältä pois.

SÄKEITÄ.
    Voi onnea joulukuista
        puun hankien saartaman!
    Sen oksat ei voi muistaa
        kesän riemua vihannan,
      ne vilun ja viiman kestää,
      ja tuiskut ei voi estää,
      että aukee sydämmestä
        itu uuden keväimen.
    Voi onnea joulukuista
        puron, jäässä jonk' aallot on!
    Sen kuplat ei voi muistaa
        kesäkatseita Apollon,
      vaan unhon nautinnoissa
      ne nukkuu kätköissä, joissa
      on tuskan tunto poissa
        ja ajan talvisen.
    Ah, noin jos huoleton, vapaa
        moni ihmislapsi ois!
    Mut ken ei surua tapaa,
        jonk' ilo pakeni pois?
      Miel' autio, murhe itää,
      sen pistot tuntea pitää,
      eikä parantajaa mitään, —
        sit' ei sanota laulaen.
OODI TOUKOKUULLE. (Katkelma).

    Oi Hermeen äiti, iki-nuori Maia,
        jos laulaa voisin
    kuin lauloi sulle rannoiltansa Baia,
        nyt etees toisin
    sen uhrihymnit ammoin kaikuneet,
    ja laulut, joita kuuli Kreikan veet,
    kun suuret runoilijat pienen maan
      niit' antoi, kuollen tyytyväisnä pois!
    Oi, anna mulle voima laulamaan,
      vaikk' yksin kukkaset sen kuulla vois
        ja taivaan sini tuo,
    ja helmassas taas iloisesti sen
        pois kuolla suo
    sun päiväs rikkauteen ja onnehen.

HYPERION.
I.
On synkkä laakso, jonka syvyyteen ei pääse aamun raitis henkäys, ei päivän kuuma, tuike tähtiyön. Siell' lepäs Saturnus, jo harmaapää, kuin kivi liikkumaton, äänetön kuin varjo-asuntonsa hiljaisuus, pääns' ympärillä metsät sankeat kuin pilvenmöhkäleet. Ei pientäkään siell' ollut ilman liikahdusta, ei tuot' elon hiukkaa päivän kesäisen, mik' ylen heikko on jo riistämään pois ruohon siemenen; jos putoskaan puust' alas kuollut lehti, siihen jäi. Siit' ohi vyöryi virta äänetön, jok' yhä kuolleemmaksi kohmettui eess' alas-syöstyn jumaluuden tuon, jok' yli laakson tumman varjon loi; ja vedenneito, päätään nostaissaan, suuns' umpeen painoi sormin viluisin.

Ja virran hiekkarantaa seuraten vei suuret jäljet, vaan ei kauemmas kuin missä jalkans' eksyi suunnastaan ja missä siitä asti nukkui hän, maall' lionneella kätens' oikean, tuon vanhan, maatess' ilman valtikkaa kuin kuolleen käsi turra, hervoton, ja silmät kiinni, kruunuttomat nyt, pää kumarassa, kuin ois kuunnellut Maan ääntä, ikivanhan äitinsä, sen hoivast' yhä hetken nauttien.

Tuost' uskonut ei minkään voiman ois hänt' ylös saavan; mutta semmoinen jo saapuikin, jok' käden vartaisen vei vanhan leveöille harteille, sit' ennen tehden syvän kunnian, työn oudon hälle, jolle kumartui. Hän oli jumalatar maailman viel' äskensyntyneen, ja rinnallaan ois pitkä amatsooni ollut vain kuin kääpiö; myös taivuttanut ois hän tukast' ottain niskat Akilleen tai Iksionin pyörän sormellaan. Kuin Memphiin sfinksin, joka auttamaan lie asetettu töitä viisasten, kun esikartanoistaan Egyptiin he tutkailevan katseens' suuntasit, niin oli kasvot nuo, — vaan kuitenkin, kuink' eri kasvot, kuinka ihanat, jos suru muovannut ei kauniimmaks ois surua kuin itse kauneus on! Ol' arka, säikkyväinen katseensa, kuin kova onni juur' ois alkanut, kuin pahan päivän pilvet enteiset ois viskelleet jo häijyn-nuoliaan ja synkät jälkikuurot jyristen ois kokoon voimiansa ajaneet. Ja kätens' siihen paikkaan painoi hän, miss' ihmisill' on kipu sydämmen, kuin tuossa juur' ois hänkin tuntenut, vaikk' kuolematon, tuskaa ankaraa. Ja toisen käden laski nojaten hän Saturnuksen niskaan kumaraan, ja kurkottaen, huulin avoimin, niin puhui jumalaiseen korvahan kuin urkuin ääni syvin, juhlaisin. Hän lausui — ah, kuin heikko kielemme, näin hauras, jumalien muinaisten suurt' ääntä, aatosta vois tulkita! — hän lausui, muodoin ylen murheisin:

"Nous' ylös, Saturnus! — mut minkävuoks? Ei, kurja vanha Kuningas, en voi ma sulle lohdutusta tuoda. En voi sanoa: 'Oi, miksi nukut sa?' Näät onhan taivas luotas loitonnut, maa enää tunne ei sua jumalaks noin rääkättynä, valtameri myös, kuink' kaikuis juhlallisna pauhu sen, ei tunne valtikkaas, ja ilmat kaikk' on majesteettis harmaan jättäneet. Sun jyrinäs, jok' uutta maailmaa ei ymmärrä, nyt vastaan ponnistain vain räiskyy yli vallan kaatuneen, ja taitamattomien kourill' ei voi salamoitas hallita — ne lyö ja paahtaa, polttaa valtakuntaa vain, tuot' ennen rauhaisaa. Voi aikaa, voi! Oi hetket pitkät, suuremmat kuin vuos, te mataissanne ylös nostakaat tuo totuus ääretön ja lyökäät se niin kiinni mielihimme tuskaisiin, ett' epäilys ei mistään sijaa saa. — Sä nuku, Saturnus! — Miks, mieletön, tein vääryytt' yksin nukkuvalle? Miks sun silmiäsi raukeit' avaisin ja raskasmielisiä? — Saturnus, sä nuku vaan! Mä itken vieressäs."

Kuin hurmiossa kauniin kesäyön, miss' seisoo vankat metsän valtiaat, nuo pitkät tammet, jotka oksillaan yöt viittaa ylös tähtiin totisiin ja liikkumatta aamust' uneksuu, vain kerran latvaans' alas taivuttain, kun yksinäinen tuulenpuuska käy yön rauhaan puhaltain ja kuollen pois kuin ilman ainut ailandus se ois, — niin syntyi sanat nuo, niin kuoli ne. Nyt jumalatar otsans' ihanan vei maahan kyynelöiden, itkien, ja tukkans' Saturnuksen jalkoihin kuin silkkipeite suortui. Öinen kuu ol' yli taivaan kannen verkalleen jo kolme kierrostansa kulkenut, vaan paikoillansa jumalaiset nuo viel' liikkumatta viipyi, muistuttain kuin veistoksia kirkon juhlaisen. Nous viimein Saturnuksen vanha pää ja silmäns' uupuneet hän auki loi ja näki kaiken: vallan kaatuneen, maan piirin pimeän ja murheisen, ja jumalattaren, jok' itki vaan. Ja parran järistessä hirmuisen hän hervottomin kielin lausui näin:

"Oi, armas vaimo Hyperionin, sun tunnen näkemättä kasvojas! Oi Theia, käännä silmäs, että voin niist' tuomiomme nähdä; katso mua ja sano, onko haamu voimaton sun eessäs Saturnus? Sä kuuletko nyt Saturnuksen ääntä? kenen on tää otsa alaston ja kurttuinen, jok' ilman kruunua näin harmaa on, se onko Saturnuksen? Ken on se, joll' oli voima kukistaakseen mun? mist' on sen väkevyys? ja kuka voi niin pursuavan raivon kasvattaa, vaikk' itse Kohtalonkin kouristin ma suonikkaissa sormissani - ken? Vaan näin on nyt. Ma häädettynä oon ja haudattuna; töitä jumalain en toimittaa voi, myötäisesti en voi kiertotähtein matkaa ohjata, en tuulten, merten voimaa hiljentää, en laupiaasti läsnä olla saa, kun viljan kalliin korjaa ihminen, en rakkauttaan viihdyttää mä voi. Ma omast' itsestän' oon luopunut, en tunne sydäntäni valtavaa, jonk' olen kadottanut jonnekin pois, vaiheille mun valtaistuimen' ja näiden paikkain, joilla istun nyt. Oi etsi, Theia, etsi! Avaja sun silmäs ikuiset ja tutkaile kaikk' etäisyydet: tähtiavaruus, maat valottomat, ilman piirit myös, ja tyhjät nummet, vuoret tuliset, kaikk' ammottavat kuilut helvetin. Oi etsi, Theia! Sana mulle tuo, jos keksit varjon, aaveolennon, mi lentäen tai tulivaunuillaan kuin hurjistunut karkaa valtaamaan taas kadonnutta taivast' omakseen. Sen täytyy — täytyy tapahtua — taas mun, Saturnuksen, olla kuningas. Niin, voitettava jalo voitto on; niin, jumaloita alas syöstäköön, ja voitonhymni soikoon pasuunain niin juhlallinen, kaunis, rauhainen kuin loisto pilven kuninkaallisen, se soikoon lempeästi, julistain ja viihdyttäin. Maass' uudistukoot taas kaikk' ihanuudet, tulkoon hämmästys suur' taivaan lapsillen. Tää käskyn' on nyt: Theia! Theia! Miss' on Saturnus?"

Tuon kiihkon valtaamana jaloilleen hän nousi, kiemurrellen käsiään, pään täristessä, hiuksin valtoimin, ja hikisenä, äänin särkynein. Hän seisoi tuijottain; ei kuullut hän kuink' itki Theia; hetken seistyään taas heräs puhumaan ja lausui näin: "Vaan enkö voi ma luoda? Enkö voi ma rakentaa? Ma enkö muovata voi uutta mailmaa, uutta taivasta, ja vanhaa murskaks lyödä? Missä on uus kaaos mulle? Missä?" Sana tuo vei kaikuns' Olympohon, säikyttäin sen kapinoivan kolmikon. — Jo nous myös Theia kavahtain, ja ryhdissään ol' ilme toivokas, kun hilpein suin hän lausui, vaikka äänin kammoisin: "Tää heimoamme rohkaisee - nyt pois, luo ystäväimme tullos, Saturnus, ja toivons' elvytä! Mä tunnen tien ja löydän turvapaikan äskeisen, mist' tulin tänne". Muut' ei virkkonut; ja tähystellen, hitain askelin hän suuntas pimentoihin. Seuraamaan läks Saturnus, jot' opas ohjaillen vei läpi vanhain oksain, väistyväin kuin sumu, jota kotkat halkaisee.

Vaan tällävälin vyöryi toisaalla niin suuret kyyneleet ja suruisat, niin suunnattomat, että mikään ei niist' ihmiskieli kerro. Titaanit sill' oihki, lymynneet tai vangitut, taas vanhat jumalansa muistaissaan, kun Saturnuksen äänen kaikua he kuulostivat mielin vihlovin. Yks vielä joukoss' oli hirmuisten, joll' ylivaltans' oli entinen ja hallitus ja majesteetti myös. Viel' istui Hyperion loistossaan ja tuli-ympyränsä äärellä tuot' uhri-suitsutusta hengitti, jok' yhä nousee maasta aurinkoon. Vaan levoton hän oli; aivan kuin maan kuolevainen synkist' enteistään on levoton ja säikkyilee, niin sai hän kammotuksen myös. Ei vavissut hän koiran ulvontaa, ei kirkunaa yöpöllön, kolkutusta vainajan, kun ruumiskellons' ensi kerran lyö, ei lampun kummitusta, kun on yö; vaan kauhun puuskat jätin jänteisiin toi tuskan suuremman. — Mut hehkuen ja kullass' uiden loisti linnansa; sen pronssipylväät pitkin varjoineen kuin veren loimon käytäville loi ja esikartanoille, kaaristoon ja kupuihin. Vaan esiriput sen, nuo aamuruskon, pilven hohteiset, yht' äkkiä nyt säikkyin tummentui: kuin kotkansiivet, joita nähnehet ei ennen jumalat, ei ihmiset loi varjons' yli seudun; kuultiin myös kuin hirnuis orhit, joita milloinkaan ei kuulleet jumalat, ei ihmiset! — Kun mielens' iloks aikoi maistaa taas hän tuoksun-hurmaa pyhäin sauhujen, joit' uhrikummuilt' ylös kohoaa, hän maun vaskenkarvaan tunsi vain ja kuvottavan löyhkän kurkussaan. Ja lähetessään lännen satamaa, miss' ihanaiset päivät päätetään, ja puhdas, jumalainen lepo on, miss' unen onni vartoo rauhainen, ei etsinyt hän nautinnoita sen, vaan esikartanosta kartanoon hän kulki pitkin, jylhin askelin; ja pienet lemmikkinsä siivekkäät pois pakenivat kauas parvittain taa pylvästen ja soppiin lymyten, niin pelvon valtaamina, kauhuissaan, kuin hädän ahdistuksess' ihmiset, jotk' yhteen sullottuina säikkyilee, kun täräjää ja tulta syöksee maa ja muurit kaatuu, järkkyy kaupungit. — Täll' aikaa astui eespäin Saturnus, viel' äsken jäisess' uness' uinaillut, ja Theian kanssa läpi metsien hän samos. — Hyperion laskeutui juur' alas lännen kynnykselle jo, yön hämärtävän taakseen jättäen. Ja hiljaa, ääntämättä aukeni kuin käskyst' ovi linnan; kuului vaan, kun lännen tuuli sormi harppuaan ja äänin totisin ja hartain soi ja viihdyttävin. — Tietä annettiin näin jumalalle sisään astua.

Hän tuli, mutta vihan vimmoissaan, kuin tulen-hulmuvilla helmoillaan ja räiskyvill' ois ajaa mielinyt pois avaruuden hetket lempeät, nuo arat linnut. Yhä eteenpäin hän riensi läpi holvein, käytäväin ja kaarien ja valon-välkkehen, ja pihain timanteista hohtavain, siks kunnes ylti kupuun korkeimpaan. Sen alla seisten synkin ilmehin hän polki jalkaa; tutjui syvänteet ja tornit, ilmanpielet horjuivat ja valtans' ääret kaikki. Ennenkuin ol' laannut vapistus ja jyskinä, suust' ääni syöksyi, patons' aukaisten, ja sanat kuului näin: "Voi unet yön ja päivänkin! Voi haamut hirmuiset! Voi tuska polttava! Voi aavehet, jotk' yhä kiertää, kiertää pimeää! Voi kummitukset kaitakorvaiset! Miks teist' en pääse? Miksi teidät nään? Miks luonton' ikuinen on järkkynyt? Miks uudet kauhut yhä seuraa mua? On syösty Saturnus. Kuin käynee mun? Mun onko täältä lähdettävä pois, miss' on mun satamani rauhainen ja kunniani kehto, missä yöt on vilpoiset ja päivät leppeät ja valon autuus yltäkylläinen, miss' sädehtivät teltat taivaiset ja missä templit kirkkaat hohtelee? Ne tyhjiks, autioiks on joutuneet. En valtakunnassani elää voi. Sen loistoa, sen suhtaisuutt' en nää, vaan pimeää, vain kuolon pimeää. Jo täälläkin, miss' illan hoivan sain, yön mustat varjot mua vallitsee ja herjan juonet kiertää teilläni. Ei, kautta Telluksen — ma kaadu en! Vaan yli laajain valtan' äärien tän hirmuisen ma käten' ojennan ja Jupiterin vallan tyhjäks teen, sen kapinoitsijan, joll' ukkonen on leikkinänsä. Vanha Saturnus taas valtaistuimelleen astukoon." Näin lausui hän, ja suussaan kotvasen viel' ankarampi kiehui uhkaus, mut ulos päässyt ei. — Kuin ihmiset, joit' tungoksessa toiset tyynnyttää, käy meluisammiks yhä, samaten, kun puhui Hyperion, kasvoi vaan tuost' uhma kummitusten kalpeain, jotk' yhä julkeammin temmelti. Ja siihen paikkaan, missä seisoi hän, nous sumu tunkkainen kuin rahkasuon, ja sumun alta kohos kiemurtain ja hiljallensa käärme niljakas, jok' äärettömin mutkin poimuillen kiers' itsens' ympärille jumalan ja tuskan-polttavaista ruumistaan nous askelittain, päätään ponnistain, ain' ylemmäs; ja kovin pingottui se voimast' ankarasta. Titaani, jo vihdoin itsens' irti riuhtaisten, löys' pakotiensä idän rantaan päin. Siell', odotellen hetket kasteiset, kun viel' ei ollut aika aamun koin, hän lepäs huohotellen, nojaten sen porttiholvikkoihin unisiin, yön usvista ne puhtaiks kirkastain ja auki äkkiä ne tempaisten, päin valtameren virtaa viileää. Mut tulipyörän tuon, joll' läntehen hän idäst' ajoi yli taivasten, nyt paksut pilvet oli verhonneet, — ei yltäpäätä kolkkoon pimeyteen, vaan että toiset pallot yhtenään, ja ilman piirit, kaaret, taivaan vyöt sen läpi kajastellen kuumotti, kuin tummennettu tulen loimotus ois kirjaellut kuvakirjaimin tuon synkän hunnun, jolta silloiset maan viisaat, miettiväiset tutkijat löys' ajatukset kalleimmat kenties, joit' ennen vuosisadat etsittiin — kaikk' kadonneet nyt: jonkun piirtosen viel' ehkä - kaiverretun kallioon tai lyödyn mustuneeseen marmoriin, mut merkityksettömän ammoin jo, ja ilman viisautta — löytää voi. — Kaks suurta, välkkyväistä siipeä tuon tulipallon kehää kaunisti, ja lähetessä jumalan ne nous kuin hurmioon. Niin kohos siivet taas, ja sulin suunnattomin halkoivat ne pimeyttä, kauaks laajeten. Vaan tulenkirkas pyörä paikoillaan viel' liikkumatta seisoi, saadakseen vain jumalaisen käskyn. Turhaan ois hän käskyns' antanutkin, turhaan hän ois valtans' ottanut ja vaatinut jo päivän alkamaan, jos vaihteluks vain tehnyt ois sen. Sit' ei voinut hän, ei, vaikka ensimmäinen jumala: näät, pyhät ajanvaiheet vuorojaan ei häiritä suo. Sikspä aamun koin viel' oli synnyt alku-asteillaan, kuin kerrottu jo on. Niin avautui nuo siivet puhtaat, sisarelliset, jo innokkaina kaartaan alkamaan; vaan tummat ulappansa sulki yö. Ja titaanin, jonk' uudet tuskat taas mielt' inhat raastoi, täytyi taipua, vaikk' ennen taipumaton, vastustain nyt ajan ankeuteen ja murheeseen. Niin ojentihe pitkin pituuttaan hän pilvivuorten päälle synkeäin, jotk' yön ja päivän rajaa vartioi, ja rinnassaan tuns' surun haikean. Vaan sääliväinen taivas tähtineen soi nääntyneelle hetken armiaan, ja takaa avaruuden kaukaisen näin kuului ääni syvä, totinen, kun Coelus hälle korvaan kuiskasi: "Oi kirkkain lapsistani armaista, maass' syntynyt ja siinnyt taivaissa, laps' salaisinten aivoitusten, joit' ei ratkaissut ne luomisvoimatkaan, joist' itse synnyit, joitten iloa ja eloisuutta, rauhaa rattoisaa viel' ihmettelen, vielä kyselen, mist' oli tulleet, minne tiensä vei. Niist' avaruuteen ijankaikkiseen on heelmät hajonneet; ja varjoss' yön on toiset, toiset ihmeit' ilmoittaa tuon elon jumalaisen ihanan. — Niist' oot sa nuorin, oot sa kirkkain, laps! Sun veljies, sun sisar-jumalais on kesken vainoa ja kapinaa, ja poik' on noussut vastaan vanhustaan. Näin kaatuneita, esikoisen' näin, kun valtaistuimeltaan syöstiin hän! Mun puoleeni hän kätens' ojenti, mun luoksen' äänensä viel' löysi tien, vaikk' kova pauhu päänsä ympäröi. Ma kalpenin, ja hiess' otsan' ui. Sua odottaisko moinen kohtalo? Sit' aavistan ma, koska nähnyt oon jo poikieni, jotka jumaliks ol' luotu, arvostansa sortuneen. Niin, jumal-elämäänpä syntyneet te ootte, säätyisään ja ylevään ja tyveneen. Se kunnianne on. Nyt nään mä pelon, vihan, pyyteiden, nään kiihkon, intohimon valtaavan teit' yhtenään, kuin asukkaita maan, kuin ihmisiä, joitten kuoltava on pois. Se huolettaa mua, poikani! Se johtaa arvaamatta turmioon ja lankeemukseen! Kuitenkaan et voi, niin jumala kuin ootkin, vastustaa tuot' inhaa vihaa, mieltä katkeraa, vaikk' ilmeiset sun suuret lahjas on. — Ma olen ääni vain. Mun elämän' on tuulten elämää ja aaltojen, ja enempää en vaikuttaa ma voi kuin tuulet taikka aallot. Vaan sä voit! Siis ollos kohtaloitten ohjissa. Niin, tartu nuolen kärkeen, ennenkuin jous' jännitetty särähtää. — Mut nyt käy maahan! Sieltä löydät tuskineen sä Saturnuksen. Sillä aikaa voin mä kirkast' aurinkoas katsastaa ja huolehtia öistäs, päivistäs." Viel' ehti kuulla tuskin puoleenkaan tuot' taivaan ääntä Hyperion, kun hän nous, ja silmänkannet kohottain yön tähtein puoleen, katsoi korkeuteen siks kunnes ääni lakkas. Vieläkin hän ylös katsoi silmin avoimin, ja samat kirkkaat, tyynet tähtöset siell' yhä loisti. Sitten painoi hän päät' alas, kohden rintaans' avaraa, ja kumartuen ilmanrantaan päin kuin sukeltaja meren aaltoihin hän syöksyi ääneti yön syvyyteen.

II.
Juur' ajan siivet saman lyönnin löi, kun Hyperion alas heittihen ja liukui syliin humisevan yön, ja jolloin Theian kanssa Saturnus tuon surun paikan saavutti, miss' soi Cybelen valitus, ja titaanit miss' istui murheissansa. Rotkon tuon ei pohjass' ollut valon hiukkaakaan, jok' kyynelissä kimaltanut ois. He oman voihkinansa tuta voi, vaan kuulla ei: näät, läpi kallioin siell' äärettömät kosket kuohuili ja virrat räiskyväiset, joissa ui ja vyöryi ainejoukot valtavat. Siell' liittyi vuoret vuoriin huimaaviin, ja niinkuin unest' äsken heränneet ne seisoi, jättiotsat vastakkain, niin kattain kärsimysten majan tuon kuin kammottavin, jylhin aatoksin. Siell' istui kivenmöhkäleillä nyt ja särmikkäillä kallioilla nuo, joill' ollut oli valtaistuin myös. Kaikk' eivät olleet koolla: tuskissaan mik' oli kahlehdittu, mikä taas miel' levotonna kulki murheineen. Ja Coeus, Gyges, Typhon, Dolor myös ja Briaraeus ja Porphyrion ja monet, jäntevimmät hyökkäämään, ol' ahdettuina soppiin, joissa voi vain vaivoin hengittää. Siell' istuivat he, hiljaa kiristellen hampaitaan. Noiss' onkaloissa tumman vankilan kuin malmisuonet kuulti jäsenet, kun koukistui ne tuskan kourissa. Viel' eli sentään suuret sydämmet: ne kivun pusertaissa verkkaan löi ja syöksyttivät läpi suonien kuin metallisen virran, hehkuvan ja valtimoita paisuttavan vuon. Pois oli Mnemosyne harhaillut, pois Foibos kuunsa luota loitonnut, ja monet nautti muutkin vapauttaan — pian kolkon suojans' etsiäkseen taas. Siell' elämäst' ei nähty enempää kuin laihat, hajalliset varjot vain. Kuin kivet raunioissa aution ja hävitetyn maan, kun marraskuu tuo illansuussa kolkon satehen, kun tuuli vonkuu, taivas musta on ja saapuu yö — niin oli nähdä nuo. Kaikk' oli onkaloissaan; toisilleen ei suoneet sanaa, silmäystä ei, ei epätoivon liikahdustakaan. Heist' yksi oli Creus, rautainen ja raskas valtikkansa vierellään. Ett' oli raivonnut hän, ennenkuin noin sortui näännyttävään syvyyteen, sen tiesi murskaks lyöty kallio. Iapetoksen kouraan tarttunut ol' etovainen käärmeen kaistale, jonk' kieli kidast' ulos pistihen ja ruumis roikkui niljakas; nyt ei sen voinut myrkkyhammas tavoittaa viel' äsken voitokasta jumalaa. Maass' aivan maaten, leuka ylöspäin, kuin kivun kouriss' oli Cottus: noin pääkalloaan hän yhä jauhenti tuoss' ankarasti kovaan kivehen, suu auki, silmät vallan ammollaan. Tuoll' Aasia, jok' kivut tuimemmat toi Tellus-äidilleen, vaikk' olikin hän nainen vain, kuin pojist' yksikään. Nyt tummat kasvons' aatost' enemmän kuin kärsimystä kuvasti, kun juur' hän ennusteli suurta mainettaan, kun mielikuvitukseens' avaraan jo hohti templit, huojui palmupuut ja loiskui Ganges-virran tummat veet. Kuin toivo nojaa ankkuriinsa, niin hän nojas — vaikka toivon vertainen ei kauneudessa — käyrään hampaaseen, jok' oli elefanttins' suurimman suust' irroitettu. Yläpuolellaan, pääll' alenevan vuoren harjanteen ol' Enceladus tumma pitkällään, pait että kyynärvarsiin nojaten pääns' oli kohotettu. Ennemmin kuin kesy härkä, jonka lempeää ei laitumella rauhaa häiritty, nyt lailla väijyväisen tiikerin ja jalopeuran raskain aatoksin hän makas miettien ja punniten. Juur' ajatuksissansa heitteli hän vuoria, kuin viel' ois taistellut sen suuren sodan keskellä, jost' ei niin vammatonna yhtään jumalaa pois päässyt nuorempaa, ett' itseään ois näyttäneet he: pedon nahkoihin ja linnun sulkiin kaikki kätkeytyi. Siell' oli Atlaskin, ja Phoreus myös, tuo Gorgoin valtias; viel' eteenpäin ol' Oceanus kanssa Thetyksen, joll' itkeväinen lepäs helmassaan Clymene, sotkettuine hiuksineen, — ja monet muut, joit' enää nimittää ei tarvis. Milloin kohti ilmoja on Runottaren siivet suunnatut, ken pidättäis sen lennostaan? — Nyt on sen aika jälleen Saturnuksen luo ja Theian, jotka vaivoin kulkeneet ol' ylen liukkaan, liejun-raskaan tien, juur' rotkot kammottavat jättäen. Päät suuret kohosivat rinnakkain nyt yli vuoren synkän jyrkänteen, ja hahmot suurenivat, kunnekka jo jalkans' ulettuivat korkeuteen ja siellä seisahtuivat. Vapisten nyt Theia kätens' ylös levitti jo ojentain ne itkun paikkaan päin hän katsoi Saturnusta kasvoihin. Niis' oli tuska julman taistelun, jok' ylijumalata järkytti, kun soti surun voimaa vastaan hän ja vihan, pelvon, tunnon vaivojen ja ahdistusten, raivon, toivon myös, mut epätoivon kaikist' enimmän. Näin vaivain saartamana ponnisti hän turhaan vastahan: näät, kohtalo oli ehtinyt jo päähän jumalan sen maisen myrkky-öljyn vuodattaa, jok' ottaa jumal-voitelunkin pois. Niin säikähtynyt Theia vaieten siit' eelleen antoi hänen astua pois, joukkoon sukukunnan sortuneen.

Maan kuolevaisten sydän murheinen, jos milloin surun paikkaa lähestyy, miss' iloton on mieli toistenkin, miss' samat kohlut syöminen rauhan vei, siit' yhä kiihtyy, yltyy vaivoissaan. Niin Saturnus, kun astui joukkohon noin murheellisten, tunsi voimansa jo pettävän, ja vaipunut hän ois, vaan silloin silmät Enceladuksen hän kohtas alamaisen ylhäiset, jost' innostuin hän äkin karjahti: "Hoi, nähkää jumalanne, titaanit!" jonk' kuultuansa toiset voihkivat ja toiset kavahtivat seisaalleen, myös jotkut karjahtivat; muutamat taas itkivät ja vaikeroivat, tai päin kumartuivat kohden jumalaa. Ops, huntuansa mustaa kohottain, soi nähdä kasvons' ylen kalpeat ja riutuneet, ja silmäns' aaveiset, joit' ohukaiset ripset ympäröi. Kuin männyt kalliolla kohahtaa, kun talven äänen kuulevat ne, niin myös liikehtivät kuolemattomat, kun jumalaiset merkit näytetään, kun sormi nousee, antain aavistaa kaikk' ylväät, sanattomat aatokset, joill' ahdettu on jumalainen suu: sen jylinän, sen soinnun, loistonkin. Vaan loppunut kun tohu mäntyin on, jotk' kalliolla seisten suhisee, niin muut' ei kuullakaan. Mut täälläpä, kun lakkas sortuneiden liikutus, siit' yltyi Saturnuksen ääni, kuin ois noussut myrsky, joka puuskahtaa vast' uudestaan, kun luonnon äänet muut juur' äsken lakkas, jälkeen jättäen vain hopeaiset ilman aaltoset. Näin kuului ääni: "Omasta en voi ma löytää rinnastain, jok' itsensä on suurin tutkija ja tuomari, syyt' yhtään kurjaan tilaanne. Sit' en voi liioin ensimmäisten päivien ma tarinoista nähdä, joita luin tuost' ihmeisestä enne-kirjasta, jonk' Uranuksen sormet kirkkahat toi pimeyden yöstä valkeuteen, kun alku-aaltoin liejussa se ui; tuon kirjan itse ijät' tiedätte mun lujall' astuimellan' säilyneen, — voi, kuinka löyhä kuitenkin! Sielt' en saa vastausta, ennusmerkeist' en, en tunnustähdist' ilman, veden, maan, en minkään elementin. Sota ei sit ilmaise, ei rauha, taistelu yks yhtä vastaan, kolminkamppaus tai neljin, puolesta tai vastakkain; ei tulen, ilman taisto räiskyvä, kun taivaan kuurot alas tulvailee, maan pintaan kumpaisenkin painaltain, siell' iskein vielä rikkiin kiehuvaan, niin monin kerroin mailmaa myllertäin. Noist' otteluista syytä löydä en, joist' oudot viisaudet mä tutkailen, miks moinen kohtalonne on. En saa ma selvitystä, kuinka etsinkin, kuin tutkinenkin luonnon rantoineen ja äärineen: miks, ilmi jumalat, te, luoduist' ensimmäiset, huokaatte näin nöyrtyneinä alle voimien, jotk' itse rinnallanne kuitenkin on vailla hirmuisuutta. Mutta nyt te ootte täällä, potkittuina pois ja runneltuina, murskattuina noin tääll' ootte te! Kuink' on, oi titaanit? Jos sanon: 'Nouskaa jo!' — vain voihkinaa. Jos sanon: 'Nöyrtykää!' — vain voihkinaa. Ma mitä voin? Oi taivas avara! Voi näkymätön, armas isäni! Ma mitä voin? Se mulle sanokaa, te veljet, jumalat: kuin taistella, ja minne vihan voimat johdattaa! Oi, neuvot antakaa, joit' isoaa jo Saturnuksen korvat kuullakseen. Sun, Oceanus, joka aprikoit kaikk' ympärinsä, hämmästyen nään jo kasvoillas tuon tyynen lujuuden, jonk' antaa harkinta. Meit' auta nyt!"

Näin Saturnus. Nyt meren jumala, tuo sofisti ja viisas — viisautens' ei lehtokujist' ollut Ateenan, vaan syvyydestä vetten miettiväin —, nous, suuret silmäluomet kohottain, ja virkkoi kielin kankein, niinkuin ois hän tuulilt', aalloilt' äänens' oppinut ja sanat vasta keksinyt kuin laps: "Voi teitä, joita vihan tuli syö, joit' intohimo kalvaa kuumeinen ja kuolon tuska polttaa! Kuunnelkaa nyt tarkkaavasti, korvin hillityin mua, jonk' ei ääni myrskyn lailla soi. Ken tahtoo, kuunnelkoon hän harkiten, kun osoitan, kuink' itsens' alentain voi tyynnä nöyrtyä, ja täytyykin. Se tieto lohduttaa ja nostaa myös, jos lohdutust' on saada tahtonne. — Me kukistumme jälkeen luonnon lain; meit' eivät kaada voimat ukkosen tai Jupiterin. Suuri Saturnus! Kaikk' olet mailmat hyvin harkinnut; vaan siksipä, ett' oot sä Kuningas, ja ylivalta silmäs sumentaa, sä ohi vaelsit sen valon tien, jot' itse kuljin iki-totuuteen. Tää huomaa: voimist' ensimmäinen et sä ollut, et oo myöskään viimeinen; siis et voi olla alku, loppukaan. Ens' alun antoi kaaos. Pimeys loi valon, siten ensi hedelmät tuost' ydin-kuohunnasta paisuttain, jok' ihmeellisin voimin itseään vaan kypsytteli. Valo, siittyään, loi uuden valon, siten synnyttäin sen, miksi syntynyt ol' itse jo; ja missä aineet suunnattomat ui, siell' eloon kaikki kosketuksellaan ne herättivät heti. Silloinpa juur' ilmestyivät maa ja taivaatkin, joist' itse sikisimme elämään: sa ensin, esikoinen, sitten me, tää jättiläisten heimo. Kaikille soi taivas valtakunnat hallita niin ihanat kuin uudetkin. Ja nyt tuo kuulkaa totuus tuskainen, jos on se tuskaks teille, mielettömät te! Näät, kantaa alastomin totuuskin, kaikk' oikut sattumuksen kohdata, ja kestää tyynin mielin — siinäpä juur' riippumattomuus on verraton. Siis huomatkaatte! Taivas ynnä maa on kauniimp', ihanampi paljonkin kuin kaaos, sumu, synkät pimeydet, jotk' ylimmäisnä kerran olivat. Ja tuolla puolen taivahan ja maan taas toiset avaruuden kappaleet on yhtenäisemmät ja kauniimmat ja vapaammat; ja viitat tuhannet siell' löytyy elon vielä puhtaamman. Niin seuraa kintereillä meitäkin uus voima, täydellisemp' entistään ja kauneudessa jalompi, jok' on meit' etevämmäks luotu, samaten kuin itse pimeyden me voitimme. Sen enemp' emme sorru itsekään kuin voitostamme kaaos muodoton. Maan mullan tiesittekö milloinkaan viel' ylpeätä metsää kironneen, jonk' oli povellansa ruokkinut se uljaammaks kuin itse olla voi? Tuot' ylemmyyttä lehtoin vihreäin se kieltää taitaako? Tai voikohan puu olla kyyhkyselle kateinen siks että lentää siivin valkoisin se minne mielii, yhä iloiten? Me oomme metsän puiden kaltaiset, jotk' kasvattivat sorjill' oksillaan, ei kyyhkyläisiä, vaan kotkia, ei sulin lumisin, vaan kultaisin ain' yli taivaan kannen kaartamaan; sen oikeuden ne kauneudelta sai, jonk' yhä valta on. Se ikuinen on laki: suurin kauneus jonk' on, sen suurin valtakin. Niin, saman lain on voimalla myös voitettavat nuo ja murtuneiksi tehtävät, jotk' on nyt meidät murtaneet. Te näittekö jo uuden, nuoren merten jumalan, mun voittajan? Ja hänen kasvonsa? Ja näittekö, kuink' aaltoin vaahtoisain hänt' yli kiidättivät vaunuillaan nuo jalot orhit, siivin hohtavin, jotk' itse loi hän? Äsken hänet näin, kun kulki yli vetten hiljaisten hän, kauneuden hehku silmissään. Se voitti mun, ja kaiken valtani ma hyvästelin mielin murheisin. Niin tulin tänne, nähdäkseni kuink' on teihin kohtalonne koskenut tuo suruinen, ja kuinka parhaiten ma voisin tuskassanne lohduttaa teit' ylen ankaroissa. Puheeni on totuus. Siinä olkoon lohtunne."

He vaikenivat; suuttumusko lie vai hämmästys sen tehnyt ankara, kun kertoi Oceanus hiljakseen, mit' aatos syvin keksiä vain voi. Ei kenkään hiljaisuutta katkaissut, pait yhtä, jonka puoleen kenenkään ei silmät sattuneet: ei vastannut Clymene liioin; valittaen vain hän huulin kalpein, katsein hiljaisin ja arastavin lausui: "Isäni, mun ääneni on halvin kaikista, ma tiedän vain, ett' ilo mennyt on, ja että murhe musta hiipinyt on sydämmiimme, jonne pelkään myös sen ainiaaksi jäävän. Pahaa en ma tahtois ennustaa, jos taitaiskaan näin heikot voimat vastaan seisoa sit' apua, jot' oikein tuomiten nyt tuotava ois suurten jumalain. Vaan sallikaa mun surun' ilmaista ja kertoa, mit' olen kuullut, mist' on itkuni ja tieto, että poiss' on kaikki toivo meiltä. Rannalla ma seisoin vilpoisalla, tuntien kuink' yli vetten tuulen henki toi maalt' ihanalta tuoksun kaukaisen kuin kukkasten ja puitten huojuvain. Niin rauhaisan se ilon mulle soi! Kuin kaihoa mun mieleni, niin täys ol' lämpöä ja armautta se. Mun sydämmeni valtaa liikutus ja halu syytellä ja soimata tät' yksinäistä kärsimystä, joss' ei lopu koskaan virret murheiset. Niin istuin rannalle, niin kumarruin ja käteheni näkinkengän sain, jonk' avoimehen kuoreen puhalsin. Se soitti sävelen — ah, kuinka voin sit' enää säveleksi kutsua! Näät, soittaissani tummaan kuorehen, jonk' äänen heikon tuulenhenki vei, ma kuulin tuolta, kussa varjokas nous saaren merellisen rantama, niin hurmaavaisen, suuren soittelon, ett' ennen moist' ei kuulleet ikänään mun korvani. Pois hekin hiekkahan ma raakunkuoren; aalto täytti sen, kuin täytti tajuntani tulvilleen tuo sävel uusi, armas, autuas. Sen soinnut helähtivät ilmoihin niin kiehtovaiset, kirkkaat, ihanat, kuin jokaisess' ois kuolo kukkinut. Ne katkesivat jälleen yksittäin, vaan kerrallansa sentään, ikäänkuin ois helmet nauhastansa pudonneet pois äkkiä. Uus lenti sävel taas, ja jälleen uus. Kuin kyyhkyt orreltaan ne lähtivät ei sulin hiljaisin, vaan siivin, jotka liiti soitellen, ja jotka, ympäri mua kiertäen, mun ilon sairaaks sai ja kaihon myös. Ja kaiho voitti; aioin sulkea juur' ylen tuskantäydet korvani, kun läpi kätten, jotka vapisi, ma äänen kuulin vielä armaamman, viel' ihanaisemman kuin soitto tuo, ja yhä huus' se toistain: 'Apollo!' ja taasen: 'Apollo! nuor' Apollo!' ja: 'aamunkirkas, nuori Apollo!' ja kaiku vastas kaukaa: 'Apollo!' Oi isäni, oi veljet armaat, jos mun ootte tuskani te tunteneet, jos tuntenut sen oot, oi Saturnus, — te ette julkeaksi syyttää voi mun kieltän' ylen hemmoteltua, kun tohti lausua se, minkä ties!"

Niin virtas äänensä kuin puronen, jok' arkaellen rantaa kiertelee ja pelkää merta kohdata; vaan nyt sen kohtas jo, ja kovin kauhistui. Suur' Enceladus, jonka suuttumus ol' ylen kuohuttanut, katkas sen; hän käsivarteens' yhä nojaten ja ylös nousematta, halveksuin näin lausui, sanat raskaat vierittäin kuin meren aallot, jotka kallioon lyö kuohahdellen: "Kumpaa kuunnella, tuot' ääntä liian viisastako, vai toist' ylen mieletöntä, jumalat? Ei ukon-isku iskun jälkehen, vaikk' kapinoivan Jupiterin ois kaikk' aseet iskemässä; maailmat ei mitkään, vaikk' ois hartioilleni ne kasatut, mua katkeroittaa vois niin syvästi kuin lapsen-lorut nuo tän julman alennuksen keskellä. Voi unelias joukko! Puhu jo! Jo huuda, voihkaa, karju, raivoa! Vai unhottuiko inhat iskut pois? Teit' eikö lasten nyrkit kaataneet? Sa unhoititko, aaltoin valtias, kuin kuumennettiin valtakunnassas sua? Mitä? Ensimmäiset sanani jo kiehuttaako sappeanne? Voi mun iloani! Viel' ei hukassa oo valtanne. Voi iloa! Nyt nään jo silmäin tuhansien loistavan ma koston riemusta!" — Näin lausuen hän suunnattomin ruumiinensa nous ja jatkoi seisten, taukoomatta, näin: "Te ootte tulta nyt. Mua kuunnelkaa, kun neuvon, kuinka liekit polttaa voi ja vihamiehist' ilmat puhdistaa, kuink' antaa tulen kielten kärventää voi Jupiterin pilvet pöyhkeät ja jäljettömiin sulattaa ne pois. Voi, syöskää päällensä ne ilkityöt, joit' on hän tehnyt! Oceanuksen vaikk' oppia ma ylen halveksun, mull' enemmästäkin on kärsimys kuin että valtakunnat menneet on: poiss' on nyt päivät unen tyvenet ja rauhaiset, tuo aika viaton, kun emme sodan töistä tietäneet ja hävityksen, jolloin luoksemme kaikk' ihanaiset taivaan olennot tul' avosilmin, arvaillakseen taas, mit' oli mielessämme kulloinkin. Viel' emme silloin tienneet, minkävuoks ja miten kirkas otsa kurttuun käy; viel' eivät huulet muuta tunteneet kuin sanat juhlalliset. Emmepä myös tienneet silloin, mitä voitto on, ja kuink' on oikku joko menettää tai saavuttaa se. — Muistakaatte myös, viel' ettei Hyperion häväisty oo, veljistämme kirkkain — katsokaa! Tuoss' saapuu hänen kirkkautensa jo!"

Kaikk' katsoi silmät Enceladukseen, jonk' ankaroilla kuulti kasvoilla — kun nimi "Hyperion" huuliltaan viel' ehti tuskin yli jyrkänteen — kuin kalvas hohto valon kaukaisen. Hän katsoi jokaista, ja kaikkien jo kasvoill' eli valon kuumotus; vaan Saturnuksen otsall' enimmän se loisti, alla hiusten valkeain kuin meren vaahti, joka kuohuaa, kun laiva laskee öiseen satamaan. Niin oli hetken kalvas hiljaisuus, vaan äkkiä loi valo kirkkahin, kuin aamun nousu, loiston kultaisen yl' unhoituksen luolain himmeäin ja jyrkänteiden, synkkäin kuilujen ja äänettömän iki-syvyyden, ja rotkojen, joist' yhä kumpuili nuo pimeyden virrat ärjyvät ja kosket, kuohuvaiset iäti. Nuo kaikki paikat, ennen pimeät ja suunnattoman varjon kattamat, nyt paljastivat kammottavan näyn. Se oli Hyperion. Vuorelle hän astui korkealle, pysähtyi ja näki kurjuuden, juur' auenneen noin ilmi-nähtäväksi itselleen, kun valo jumalainen petti sen. Niin hiuksin kultaisin ja kiharin hän seisoi, hahmo kuninkaallinen, ja omaan valohonsa varjon loi, kuin heittää varjon patsas Memnonin, kun matkalainen suuntaa länteen päin pois idän hämärästä. Seistessään hän kätens' yhteen painoi miettien ja huokaili kuin harppu suruinen tuon Memnonin. Taas lyödyt jumalat tuost' epätoivo valtas, nähdessään noin murtuneena päivän kuninkaan, ja moni kätki salaa kasvonsa pois valon tieltä. Enceladus vaan loi silmät tuimat veljesjoukkohon; sen tuntiessaan nous Iapetos, ja Creus myös, ja Phorcus, meren laps, ja yhdessä he sinne astuivat, miss' yksin seisoi kunniassaan hän. Sielt' yhtyneinä neljin huusivat he Saturnuksen nimen. Huipultaan myös Hyperion vastas: "Saturnus!" Ja kasvot jumalien äidinkin, jonk' istui lähistössä Saturnus, ol' ilottomat aivan, kuullessaan, kuink' ympärillään kaikki jumalat huus' ontoin äänin nimen: "Saturnus!"

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
